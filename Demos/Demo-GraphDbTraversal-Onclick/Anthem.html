<p>Section 1. Schedule of Benefits (Who Pays What)
In this section you will find an outline of the benefits included in your Plan and a summary of any
Deductibles, Coinsurance, and Copayments that you must pay. Also listed are any Benefit Period
Maximums or limits that apply. Please read the "Benefits/Coverage (What is Covered)" section for more
details on the Plan&rsquo;s Covered Services. Read the &ldquo;Limitations/Exclusions (What is Not Covered)&rdquo; section
for details on Excluded Services.
</p>
<p>All Covered Services are subject to the conditions, Exclusions, limitations, and terms of this Booklet
including any endorsements, amendments, or riders.
</p>
<p>To get benefits under this Plan, you must get Covered Services from an In-Network Provider.
Services from an Out-of-Network Provider are not covered, except for Emergency Care or
Authorized Services. Please be sure to contact us if you are not sure if we have approved an
Authorized Service.
</p>
<p>Deductibles, Coinsurance, and Benefit Period Maximums are calculated based upon the Maximum
Allowed Amount, not the Provider&rsquo;s billed charges.
</p>
<p>Essential Health Benefits provided within this Booklet are not subject to lifetime or annual dollar
maximums. Certain non-essential health benefits, however, are subject to either a lifetime and/or
dollar maximum.
</p>
<p>Essential Health Benefits are defined by federal law and refer to benefits in at least the following
categories:
</p>
<p>&middot; Ambulatory patient services,
&middot; Emergency services,
&middot; Hospitalization,
&middot; Maternity and newborn care,
&middot; Mental health and substance use disorder services, including behavioral health treatment,
&middot; Prescription drugs,
&middot; Rehabilitative and Habilitative Services and devices,
&middot; Laboratory services,
&middot; Preventive and wellness services, and
&middot; Chronic disease management and pediatric services, including oral and vision care.
</p>
<p>Such benefits shall be consistent with those set forth under the Patient Protection and Affordable
Care Act of 2010 and any state or federal regulations issued pursuant thereto.
</p>
<p>Benefit Period Calendar Year
</p>
<p>Dependent Age Limit To the end of the month in which the child attains

<p>When the Deductible applies, you must pay it before benefits begin. See the sections below to find out
when the Deductible applies.
</p>
<p>Copayments and Coinsurance are separate from and do not apply to the Deductible.
</p>
<p>Coinsurance In-Network
</p>
<p>Plan Pays 70%
</p>
<p>Member Pays 30%
</p>
<p>Reminder: Your Coinsurance will be based on the Maximum Allowed Amount.
</p>
<p>Note: The Coinsurance listed above may not apply to all benefits, and some benefits may have a
different Coinsurance. Please see the rest of this Schedule for details.
</p>

</p>
<p>Per Member $7,150
</p>
<p>Per Family
All other Members combined
</p>
<p>$14,300
</p>
<p>The Out-of-Pocket Limit includes all Deductibles, Coinsurance, and Copayments you pay during a
Benefit Period unless otherwise indicated below. It does not include charges over the Maximum Allowed
Amount or amounts you pay for non-Covered Services.
</p>
<p>The Out-of-Pocket Limit does not include amounts you pay for the following benefits:
</p>
<p>&middot; Services listed under &ldquo;Vision Services for Members Age 19 and Older&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Once the Out-of- Pocket Limit is satisfied, you will not have to pay additional Deductibles, Coinsurance,
or Copayments for the rest of the Benefit Period, except for the services listed above.
</p>
<p>Important Notice about Your Cost Shares
</p>
<p>In certain cases, if we pay a Provider amounts that are your responsibility, such as Deductibles,
Copayments or Coinsurance, we may collect such amounts directly from you. You agree that we have the
right to collect such amounts from you.
</p>
<p>The tables below outline the Plan&rsquo;s Covered Services and the cost share(s) you must pay. In many spots
you will see the statement, &ldquo;Benefits are based on the setting in which Covered Services are received.&rdquo;
In these cases you should determine where you will receive the service (i.e., in a doctor&rsquo;s office, at an
outpatient hospital facility, etc.) and look up that location to find out which cost share will apply. For
example, you might get physical therapy in a doctor&rsquo;s office, an outpatient hospital facility, or during an
inpatient hospital stay. For services in the office, look up &ldquo;Office Visits.&rdquo; For services in the outpatient
department of a hospital, look up &ldquo;Outpatient Facility Services.&rdquo; For services during an inpatient stay,
look up &ldquo;Inpatient Services.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Statement of Rights under the Newborns&rsquo; and Mother&rsquo;s Health

<p>Group health plans and health insurance issuers generally may not, under Federal law, restrict benefits
for any Hospital length of stay in connection with childbirth for the mother or newborn child to less than 48
hours following a vaginal delivery, or less than 96 hours following a cesarean section. However, Federal
law generally does not prohibit the mother&rsquo;s or newborn&rsquo;s attending Provider, after consulting with the
mother, from discharging the mother or her newborn earlier than 48 hours (or 96 hours as applicable). In
any case, plans and issuers may not, under Federal law, require that a provider obtain authorization from
the Plan or the insurance issuer for prescribing a length of stay not in excess of 48 hours (or 96 hours).
</p>
<p>Statement of Rights under the Women&rsquo;s Cancer Rights Act of 1998
</p>
<p>If you have had or are going to have a mastectomy, you may be entitled to certain benefits under the
Women&rsquo;s Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1998 (WHCRA). For individuals receiving mastectomy-related
benefits, coverage will be provided in a manner determined in consultation with the attending Physician
and the patient, for:
</p>
<p>&middot; All stages of reconstruction of the breast on which the mastectomy was performed;
&middot; Surgery and reconstruction of the other breast to produce a symmetrical appearance;
&middot; Prostheses; and
&middot; Treatment of physical complications of the mastectomy, including lymphedema.
</p>
<p>These benefits will be provided subject to the same Deductibles and Coinsurance applicable to other
medical and surgical benefits provided under this Plan. (See the &ldquo;Schedule of Benefits (Who Pays What)&rdquo;
for details.) If you would like more information on WHCRA benefits, call us at the number on the back of
your Identification Card.
</p>
<p>Coverage for a Child Due to a Qualified Medical Support Order
(&ldquo;QMCSO&rdquo;)
</p>
<p>If you or your spouse are required, due to a QMCSO, to provide coverage for your child(ren), you may
ask the Group to provide you, without charge, a written statement outlining the procedures for getting
coverage for such child(ren).
</p>
<p>Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act
</p>
<p>The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act provides for parity in the application of aggregate
treatment limitations (day or visit limits) on mental health and substance abuse benefits with day or visit
limits on medical and surgical benefits. In general, group health plans offering mental health and
substance abuse benefits cannot set day/visit limits on mental health or substance abuse benefits that
are lower than any such day or visit limits for medical and surgical benefits. A plan that does not impose
day or visit limits on medical and surgical benefits may not impose such day or visit limits on mental
health and substance abuse benefits offered under the Plan. Also, the Plan may not impose Deductibles,
Copayment, Coinsurance, and out of pocket expenses on mental health and substance abuse benefits
that are more restrictive than Deductibles, Copayment, Coinsurance and out of pocket expenses
applicable to other medical and surgical benefits. Medical Necessity criteria are available upon request.</p>

<p>Special Enrollment Notice
</p>
<p>If you are declining enrollment for yourself or your Dependents (including your spouse) because of other
health insurance coverage, you may in the future be able to enroll yourself or your Dependents in this
Plan if you or your Dependents lose eligibility for that other coverage (or if the employer stops contributing
towards your or your Dependents&rsquo; other coverage). However, you must request enrollment within 31 days
after your or your Dependents&rsquo; other coverage ends (or after the employer stops contributing toward the
other coverage).
</p>
<p>In addition, if you have a new Dependent as a result of marriage, birth, adoption, or placement for
adoption, you may be able to enroll yourself and Your Dependents. However, you must request
enrollment within 31 days after the marriage, birth, adoption, or placement for adoption.
</p>
<p>Eligible Subscribers and Dependents may also enroll under two additional circumstances:
</p>
<p>&middot; The Subscriber&rsquo;s or Dependent&rsquo;s Medicaid or Children&rsquo;s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) coverage
is terminated as a result of loss of eligibility; or
</p>
<p>&middot; The Subscriber or Dependent becomes eligible for a subsidy (state premium assistance program).
</p>
<p>The Subscriber or Dependent must request Special Enrollment within 60 days of the loss of
Medicaid/CHIP or of the eligibility determination.

</p>
<p>Statement of ERISA Rights
</p>
<p>Please note:  This section applies to employer sponsored plans other than Church employer groups and
government groups.  If you have questions about whether this Plan is governed by ERISA, please contact
the Plan Administrator (the Group).
</p>
<p>The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) entitles you, as a Member of the Group
under this Contract, to:
</p>
<p>&middot; Examine, without charge, at the Plan Administrator&rsquo;s office and at other specified locations such as
worksites and union halls, all plan documents, including insurance contracts, collective bargaining
agreements and copies of all documents filed by this plan with the U.S. Department of Labor, such as
detailed annual reports and plan descriptions;
</p>
<p>&middot; Obtain copies of all plan documents and other plan information upon written request to the Plan
Administrator.  The Plan Administrator may make a reasonable charge for these copies; and
</p>
<p>&middot; Receive a summary of the plan&rsquo;s annual financial report.  The Plan Administrator is required by law to
furnish each participant with a copy of this summary financial report.
</p>
<p>In addition to creating rights for you and other employees, ERISA imposes duties on the people
responsible for the operation of your employee benefit plan.  The people who operate your plan are called
plan fiduciaries.  They must handle your plan prudently and in the best interest of you and other plan
participants and beneficiaries.  No one, including your employer, your union, or any other person, may fire
you or otherwise discriminate against you in any way to prevent you from obtaining a welfare benefit or
exercising your right under ERISA.  If your claim for welfare benefits is denied, in whole or in part, you
must receive a written explanation of the reason for the denial.  You have the right to have your claims
reviewed and reconsidered.
</p>
<p>Under ERISA, there are steps you can take to enforce the above rights.  For instance, if you request
materials from the Plan Administrator and do not receive them within 30 days, you may file suit in a</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>23
</p>
<p>federal court.  In such case, the court may require the Plan Administrator to provide you the materials and
pay you up to $110 a day until you receive the materials, unless the materials are not sent because of
reasons beyond the control of the Plan Administrator.  If your claim for benefits is denied or ignored, in
whole or in part, you may file suit in a state or federal court.  If plan fiduciaries misuse the plan&rsquo;s money or
if you are discriminated against for asserting your rights, you may seek assistance from the U.S.
Department of Labor, or may file suit in a federal court.  The court will decide who should pay court costs
and legal fees.  It may order you to pay these expenses, for example, if it finds your claim is frivolous.  If
you have any questions about your plan, you should contact the Plan Administrator.  If you have any
questions about this statement or about your rights under ERISA, you should contact the nearest office of
the Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, listed in your telephone
directory or the Division of Technical Assistance and Inquiries, Employee Benefits Security
Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20210.</p>

</p>
<p>Cancer Screenings
</p>
<p>At Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield and our subsidiary company, HMO Colorado, Inc., we believe
cancer screenings provide important preventive care that supports our mission: to improve the lives of the
people we serve and the health of our communities. We cover cancer screenings as described below.
</p>
<p>Pap Tests
</p>
<p>All Plans provide coverage under the preventive care benefits for a routine annual Pap test and the
related office visit. Payment for the routine Pap test is based on the Plan&rsquo;s provisions for preventive care
service. Payment for the related office visit is based on the Plan&rsquo;s preventive care provisions.
</p>
<p>Mammogram Screenings
</p>
<p>All Plans provide coverage under the preventive care benefits for routine screening or diagnostic
mammogram regardless of age. Payment for the mammogram screening benefit is based on the Plan&rsquo;s
provisions for preventive care.

<p>Several types of colorectal cancer screening methods exist. All Plans provide coverage for routine
colorectal cancer screenings, such as fecal occult blood tests, barium enema, sigmoidoscopies and
colonoscopies. Depending on the type of colorectal cancer screening received, payment for the benefit is
based on where the services are rendered and if rendered as a screening or medical procedure.
Colorectal cancer screenings are covered under preventive care as long as the services provided are for
a preventive screening. Payment for preventive colorectal cancer screenings based on the Plan&rsquo;s
provisions for preventive care.
</p>
<p>No-Adult Dental Services
</p>
<p>This policy does not provide any dental benefits to individuals age nineteen (19) or older, except as
specifically provided in the benefit booklet. This policy is being offered so the purchaser will have
pediatric dental coverage as required by the Affordable Care Act. If you want adult dental benefits, you
will need to buy a plan that has adult dental benefits. Except as stated in the benefit booklet, this plan will
not pay for any adult dental care, so you will have to pay the full price of any care you receive.</p>

</p>
<p>Welcome to HMO Colorado!
</p>
<p>We are pleased that you have become a Member of our health insurance Plan. We want to make sure
that our services are easy to use. We&rsquo;ve designed this Booklet to give a clear description of your
benefits, as well as our rules and procedures.
</p>
<p>The Booklet explains many of the rights and duties between you and us. It also describes how to get
health care, what services are covered, and what part of the costs you will need to pay. Many parts of
this Booklet are related. Therefore, reading just one or two sections may not give you a full understanding
of your coverage. You should read the whole Booklet to know the terms of your coverage.
</p>
<p>This Booklet replaces any Booklet issued to you in the past. The coverage described is based upon the
terms of the Group Contract issued to your Group, and the Plan that your Group chose for you. This
Booklet, and any endorsements, amendments or riders attached, form the entire legal contract under
which Covered Services are available. In addition the Group has a Group Contract and Group Application
which includes terms that apply to this coverage.
</p>
<p>Many words used in the Booklet have special meanings (e.g., Group, Covered Services, and Medical
Necessity). These words are capitalized and are defined in the "Definitions" section. See these
definitions for the best understanding of what is being stated. Throughout this Booklet you will also see
references to &ldquo;we,&rdquo; &ldquo;us,&rdquo; &ldquo;our,&rdquo; &ldquo;you,&rdquo; and &ldquo;your.&rdquo; The words &ldquo;we,&rdquo; &ldquo;us,&rdquo; and &ldquo;our&rdquo; mean HMO Colorado.
The words &ldquo;you&rdquo; and &ldquo;your&rdquo; mean the Member, Subscriber and each covered Dependent.

<p>Section 5. Eligibility
In this section you will find information on who is eligible for coverage under this Plan and when Members
can be added to your coverage. Eligibility requirements are described in general terms below. For more
specific information, please see your Human Resources or Benefits Department.
</p>
<p>Who is Eligible for Coverage
</p>
<p>The Subscriber
</p>
<p>To be eligible to enroll as a Subscriber, the individual must:
</p>
<p>&middot; Be an employee of the Group, and;
&middot; Be entitled to participate in the benefit Plan arranged by the Group, and;
&middot; Have satisfied any probationary or waiting period established by the Group and perform the duties of
</p>
<p>your principal occupation for the Group; and
&middot; Reside or work in the Service Area.
</p>
<p>Dependents
</p>
<p>To be eligible to enroll as a Dependent, you must be listed on the enrollment form completed by the
Subscriber, meet all Dependent eligibility criteria established by the Group, and be one of the following:
</p>
<p>&middot; The Subscribers spouse, including the partner to a civil union as recognized by Colorado law. For
information on spousal eligibility please contact the Group.
</p>
<p>&middot; Common-law spouse. A Common-Law Marriage Affidavit is needed to enroll a common-law spouse.
You can get the affidavit from your employer or you can call us. All references to spouse in this
Booklet include a common-law spouse.
</p>
<p>A common law spouse is an eligible Dependent who has a valid common-law marriage in Colorado.
This is the same as any other marriage and can only end by death or divorce.
</p>
<p>&middot; Designated beneficiary. Your Group may have decided to offer benefits under this plan to designated
beneficiaries. Check with your Group to learn more. If they are recognized by the Group, all
references to spouse in this Booklet include a designated beneficiary. A Recorded Designated
Beneficiary Agreement will need to be provided. A designated beneficiary is not eligible for COBRA
under this Booklet.
</p>
<p>A designated beneficiary is an agreement entered into by two people for the purpose of making each
a beneficiary of the other and which has been recorded with the county clerk and recorder in the
county in which one of the person lives. The agreement is based on the Colorado Designated
Beneficiary Act.
</p>
<p>&middot; Same-sex domestic partner. Domestic Partner, or Domestic Partnership means a person of the same
sex who has signed the Domestic Partner Affidavit certifying that he or she is the Subscriber&rsquo;s sole
Domestic Partner; he or she is mentally competent; he or she is not related to the Subscriber by
blood closer than permitted by state law for marriage; he or she is not married to anyone else; and he
or she is financially interdependent with the Subscriber.
</p>
<p>For purposes of this Plan, a Domestic Partner or partner to a recognized civil union shall be treated
the same as a spouse, and that partner&rsquo;s child, adopted child, or child for whom he or she has legal
guardianship shall be treated the same as any other child. The coverage of a Domestic Partner, civil
union partner, or the child of such partner ends on the date of dissolution of the Domestic Partnership
or civil union.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>35
</p>
<p>While this Booklet will recognize and provide benefits for a Member who is a spouse or child in
connection with a Domestic Partner or recognized civil union relationship, not every federal or state
law that applies to a Member who is a spouse or child under this Plan will also apply to a Domestic
Partner or a partner under a civil union. This includes but is not limited to, COBRA and FMLA.
</p>
<p>We reserve the right to make the ultimate decision in determining eligibility of the Domestic Partner.
</p>
<p>&middot; The Subscriber&rsquo;s or the Subscriber&rsquo;s spouse&rsquo;s children, including natural children, stepchildren,
newborn and legally adopted children and children who the Group has determined are covered under
a Qualified Medical Child Support Order as defined by ERISA or any applicable state law.
</p>
<p>&middot; Children, including grandchildren, for whom the Subscriber or the Subscriber&rsquo;s spouse is a permanent
legal guardian or as otherwise required by law.
</p>
<p>All enrolled eligible children will continue to be covered until the age limit listed in the &ldquo;Schedule of
Benefits (Who Pays What)&rdquo;. Coverage may be continued past the age limit in the following circumstances:
</p>
<p>&middot; Eligibility will be continued past the age limit only for those Dependents who are unmarried and
medically certified as disabled and are dependent upon the parent Subscriber. We may ask for a
physician to certify the Dependent&rsquo;s eligibility. We must be informed of the Dependent&rsquo;s eligibility for
continuation of coverage within 30 days after the date Dependent would normally become ineligible.
You must notify Us if the Dependent&rsquo;s tax exemption status changes and if he or she is no longer
eligible for continued coverage.
</p>
<p>We may require you to give proof of continued eligibility for any enrolled child. Your failure to give this
information could result in termination of a child&rsquo;s coverage.
</p>
<p>To obtain coverage for children, we may require you to give us a copy of any legal documents awarding
permanent guardianship of such child(ren) to you.
</p>
<p>Your group may have limited or excluded the eligibility of certain Dependent types and so not all
Dependents listed in this Plan may be entitled to enroll. For more specific information, please see your
Human Resources or Benefits Department.
</p>
<p>Types of Coverage
</p>
<p>Your Group offers some or all of the enrollment options listed below. After reviewing the available
options, you may choose the option that best meets your needs. The options may include:
</p>
<p>&middot; Subscriber only (also referred to as single coverage);
&middot; Subscriber and spouse; or Domestic Partner;
&middot; Subscriber and child(ren);
&middot; Subscriber and family.
</p>
<p>When You Can Enroll
</p>
<p>Initial Enrollment
</p>
<p>The Group will offer an initial enrollment period to new Subscribers and their Dependents when the
Subscriber is first eligible for coverage. Coverage will be effective based on the waiting period chosen by
the Group, and will not exceed 90 days.
</p>
<p>If you did not enroll yourself and/or your Dependents during the initial enrollment period you will only be
able to enroll during an Open Enrollment period or during a Special Enrollment period, as described
below.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>36
</p>
<p>Open Enrollment
</p>
<p>Open Enrollment refers to a period of time, usually 60 days, during which eligible Subscribers and
Dependents can apply for or change coverage. Open Enrollment occurs only once per year. The Group
will notify you when Open Enrollment is available.
</p>
<p>Special Enrollment Periods
</p>
<p>If a Subscriber or Dependent does not apply for coverage when they were first eligible, they may be able
to join the Plan prior to Open Enrollment if they qualify for Special Enrollment. Except as noted otherwise
below, the Subscriber or Dependent must request Special Enrollment within 31 days of a qualifying event.
</p>
<p>If an individual is notified or becomes aware of a qualifying event that will occur in the future, he or she
may apply for coverage during the thirty (30) calendar days prior to the effective date of the qualifying
event, with coverage beginning no earlier than the day the qualifying event occurs to avoid a gap in
coverage. The individual must be able to provide written documentation to support the effective date of
the triggering event at the time of application.
</p>
<p>Special Enrollment is available for eligible individuals who:
</p>
<p>&middot; Lost eligibility under a prior health plan for reasons other than non-payment of premium or due to
fraud or intentional misrepresentation of a material fact;
</p>
<p>&middot; Lost coverage due to death of a covered employee; the termination or reduction in number of hours of
the covered employee&rsquo;s employment, regardless of eligibility for COBRA or state continuation
coverage; involuntary termination of coverage; lost eligibility under the Colorado Medical Assistance
Act or the Children&rsquo;s Basic Health Plan; or the covered employee becoming eligible for benefits under
Title XVIII of the Federal Social Security Act, as amended;
</p>
<p>&middot; Lost coverage under a health benefit plan due to the divorce or legal separation of the covered
employee from the covered employee&rsquo;s spouse or partner in civil union, or due to the termination of a
recognized domestic partnership;
</p>
<p>&middot; Is now eligible for coverage due to marriage (including a civil union where recognized in the state
where the Subscriber resides), birth, adoption, placement for adoption, placement in foster care, by
entering into a Designated Beneficiary Agreement, or pursuant to a QMCSO or other court or
administrative order mandating that the individual be covered;
</p>
<p>&middot; Exhausted COBRA or state continuation benefits or stopped receiving group contributions toward the
cost of the prior health plan; or
</p>
<p>&middot; Lost employer contributions towards the cost of the other coverage.
</p>
<p>Important Notes about Special Enrollment:
</p>
<p>&middot; Members who enroll during Special Enrollment are not considered Late Enrollees.
&middot; Individuals must request coverage within 31 days of a qualifying event (i.e., marriage, exhaustion of
</p>
<p>COBRA, etc.).
</p>
<p>If the Subscriber does not enroll themselves and/or their Dependents when first eligible or during a
Special Enrollment period, they will not be eligible to enroll until the next Open Enrollment Period.
</p>
<p>Special Rules if Your Group Health Plan is Offered Through an Exchange
</p>
<p>If your Plan is offered through a public exchange operated by the state or federal government as part of
the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (&ldquo;Exchange&rdquo;), all enrollment changes must be made
through the Exchange by you or your Group. Each Exchange will have rules on how to do this. For plans
offered on the Exchange there are additional opportunities for Special Enrollment. They include:</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>37
</p>
<p>&middot; Your enrollment or non-enrollment in another qualified health plan was unintentional, inadvertent or
erroneous and was a result of an error, misrepresentation, or inaction by an employee or
representative of the Exchange;
</p>
<p>&middot; You adequately demonstrate to the Exchange that the health plan under which you are enrolled has
substantially violated a material provision of its contract with you;
</p>
<p>&middot; You move and become eligible for new qualified health plans;
</p>
<p>&middot; You are a Native American Indian, as defined by section 4 of the Indian Health Care Improvement
Act, and allowed to change from one qualified health plan to another as often as once per month; or
</p>
<p>&middot; The Exchange determines, under federal law, that you meet other exceptional circumstances that
warrant a Special Enrollment.
</p>
<p>You must give the Exchange notice within 30 days of the above events if you wish to enroll.
</p>
<p>Medicaid and Children&rsquo;s Health Insurance Program Special Enrollment
</p>
<p>Eligible Subscribers and Dependents may also enroll under two additional circumstances:
</p>
<p>&middot; The Subscriber&rsquo;s or Dependent&rsquo;s Medicaid or Children&rsquo;s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) coverage
is terminated as a result of loss of eligibility; or
</p>
<p>&middot; The Subscriber or Dependent becomes eligible for a subsidy (state premium assistance program)
</p>
<p>The Subscriber or Dependent must request Special Enrollment within 60 days of the above events.
</p>
<p>Late Enrollees
If the Subscriber does not enroll themselves and/or their Dependents when first eligible or during a
Special Enrollment period, they will not be eligible to enroll until the next Open Enrollment Period.
</p>
<p>Members Covered Under the Group&rsquo;s Prior Plan
</p>
<p>Members who were previously enrolled under another plan offered by the Group that is being replaced by
this Plan are eligible for coverage on the Effective Date of this coverage.
</p>
<p>Enrolling Dependent Children
</p>
<p>Newborn Children
</p>
<p>Newborn children are covered automatically from the moment of birth. Following the birth of a child, you
should submit an application / change form to the Group within 31, but no more than 60, days to add the
newborn to your Plan. During the first 31 days after birth, a newborn child will be covered for Medically
Necessary care. This includes well child care and treatment of medically diagnosed congenital defects
and birth abnormalities. This is regardless of the limitations and exclusions applicable to other conditions
or procedures of this Booklet.
</p>
<p>Even if no additional Premium is required, you should still submit an application / change form to the
Group to add the newborn to your Plan, to make sure we have accurate records and are able to cover
your claims.
</p>
<p>Adopted Children
</p>
<p>A child will be considered adopted from the earlier of: (1) the moment of placement in your home; or (2)
the date of an entry of an order granting custody of the child to you. The placement begins when you</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>38
</p>
<p>assume or retain a legal obligation to partially or totally support a child in anticipation of the child's
adoption. A placement terminates at the time such legal obligation terminates. The child will continue to
be considered adopted unless the child is removed from your home prior to issuance of a legal decree of
adoption.
</p>
<p>Your Dependent&rsquo;s Effective Date will be the date of the adoption or placement for adoption if you send us
the completed application / change form within 31 days of the event.
</p>
<p>Adding a Child due to Award of Legal Custody or Guardianship
</p>
<p>If you or your spouse is awarded permanent legal custody or permanent guardianship for a child, an
application must be submitted within 31 days of the date legal custody or guardianship is awarded by the
court. Coverage will be effective on the date the court granted legal custody or guardianship.
</p>
<p>Any foster child who is eligible for benefits provided by any governmental program or law will not be
eligible for coverage under this Booklet unless required by the laws of this state.
</p>
<p>Qualified Medical Child Support Order
</p>
<p>If you are required by a qualified medical child support order or court order, as defined by ERISA and/or
applicable state or federal law, to enroll your child in this Plan, we will permit the child to enroll at any time
without regard to any Open Enrollment limits and will provide the benefits of this Plan according to the
applicable requirements of such order. However, a child's coverage will not extend beyond any
Dependent Age Limit listed in the &ldquo;Schedule of Benefits (Who Pays What)&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>Updating Coverage and/or Removing Dependents
</p>
<p>You are required to notify the Group of any changes that affect your eligibility or the eligibility of your
Dependents for this Plan. When any of the following occurs, contact the Group and complete the
appropriate forms:
</p>
<p>&middot; Changes in address;
&middot; Marriage or divorce or entering into or terminating a recognized civil union or domestic partnership;
&middot; Death of an enrolled family member (a different type of coverage may be necessary);
&middot; Enrollment in another health plan or in Medicare;
&middot; Eligibility for Medicare;
&middot; Dependent child reaching the Dependent Age Limit (see &ldquo;Termination/Nonrenewal/Continuation&rdquo;);
&middot; Enrolled Dependent child either becomes totally or permanently disabled, or is no longer disabled.
</p>
<p>Failure to notify us of individuals no longer eligible for services will not obligate us to cover such services,
even if Premium is received for those individuals. All notifications must be in writing and on approved
forms.
</p>
<p>Nondiscrimination
</p>
<p>No person who is eligible to enroll will be refused enrollment based on health status, health care needs,
genetic information, previous medical information, disability, sexual orientation or identity, gender or age.
</p>
<p>Statements and Forms
</p>
<p>All Members must complete and submit applications or other forms or statements that we may reasonably
request.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>39
</p>
<p>Any rights to benefits under this Plan are subject to the condition that all such information is true, correct,
and complete. Any intentional material misrepresentation by you may result in termination of coverage as
provided in the "Termination/Nonrenewal/Continuation" section. We will not use a statement made by you
to void or reduce your coverage after that coverage has been in effect for two years, unless such
statement is contained in a written instrument signed by you making such statement and a copy of that
instrument is or has been given to you or your beneficiary.</p>

</p>
<p>Section 6. How to Access Your Services and Obtain Approval
of Benefits (Applicable to managed care plans)
</p>
<p>Introduction
</p>
<p>Your Plan is a HMO plan. To get benefits for Covered Services, you must use In-Network
Providers, unless we have approved an Authorized Service or if your care involves Emergency
Care.
</p>
<p>In-Network Provider Services
</p>
<p>When you get care from an In-Network Provider or as part of an Authorized Service, benefits are
available for Covered Services. Regardless of Medical Necessity, benefits will be denied for care that is
not a Covered Service. We have final authority to decide the Medical Necessity of the service.
</p>
<p>If We do not have an In-Network Provider for a Covered Service, we will arrange for an authorization to a
Provider with the necessary expertise. We will also make sure that you receive the Covered Service at
no greater cost than what you would have paid for such Covered Service if it had been received from an
In-Network Provider. For example, some Hospital-based labs are not part of our Reference Lab Network.
Please read the &ldquo;Member Payment Responsibility&rdquo; section for additional information on Authorized
Services.
</p>
<p>Primary Care Physicians / Providers (PCP)
</p>
<p>PCPs include general practitioners, internists, family practitioners, and pediatricians. Each Member
should choose a PCP who is listed in the Provider directory. Each Member of a family may select a
different Primary Care Physician. For example, an internist or general practitioner may be chosen for
adults and a pediatrician may be selected for children. If you want to change your PCP, call us or see our
website, www.anthem.com.
</p>
<p>The Primary Care Physician is the Doctor who normally gives, directs, and manages your health care.
</p>
<p>If, when you first enroll (sign up) for coverage under this Plan, you are under the care of an Out-of-
Network Provider, you should tell us right away. To keep getting care under this Plan from any Out-of-
Network Provider, we must approve an Authorized Service with that Provider or the services will be
denied.
</p>
<p>First - Make an Office Visit with Your PCP
</p>
<p>Your PCP's job is to help you stay healthy, not just treat you when you are sick. After you pick a PCP set
up an office visit. During this visit, get to know your PCP and help your PCP get to know you. You
should talk to your PCP about:
</p>
<p>&middot; Your personal health history,
&middot; Your family health history,
&middot; Your lifestyle,
&middot; Any health concerns you have.
</p>
<p>If you do not get to know your PCP, they may not be able to properly manage your care. To see a Doctor,
call their office:
</p>
<p>&middot; Tell them you are an HMO Colorado Member,</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>41
</p>
<p>&middot; Have your Member Identification Card handy. The Doctor&rsquo;s office may ask you for your group or
Member ID number.
</p>
<p>&middot; Tell them the reason for your visit.
</p>
<p>When you go to the office, be sure to bring your Member Identification Card with you.
</p>
<p>If you need to see a Specialist, you can visit any In-Network Specialist including a behavioral health
Provider. You do not have to get a referral.
</p>
<p>If you have any questions about Covered Services, call us at the telephone number listed on the back of
your Identification Card.
</p>
<p>After Hours Care
</p>
<p>If you need care after normal business hours, your Doctor may have several options for you. You should
call your Doctor&rsquo;s office for instructions if you need care in the evenings, on weekends, or during the
holidays and cannot wait until the office reopens. If you have an Emergency, call 911 or go to the nearest
Emergency Room.
</p>
<p>How to Find a Provider in the Network
</p>
<p>There are three ways you can find out if a Provider or Facility is in the network for this Plan. You can also
find out where they are located and details about their license or training.
</p>
<p>&middot; See your Plan&rsquo;s directory of In-Network Providers at www.anthem.com, which lists the Doctors,
Providers, and Facilities that participate in this Plan&rsquo;s network.
</p>
<p>&middot; Call Member Services to ask for a list of Doctors and Providers that participate in this Plan&rsquo;s network,
based on specialty and geographic area.
</p>
<p>&middot; Check with your Doctor or Provider.
</p>
<p>Please note that not all In-Network Providers offer all services. For example, some Hospital-based labs
are not part of our Reference Lab Network. In those cases you will have to go to a lab in our Reference
Lab Network to get In-Network benefits. Please call Member Services before you get services for more
information.
</p>
<p>If you need details about a Provider&rsquo;s license or training, or help choosing a Doctor who is right for you,
call the Member Services number on the back of your Member Identification Card. TTY/TDD services
also are available by dialing 711. A special operator will get in touch with us to help with your needs.
</p>
<p>Please note that we have several networks, and that a Provider that is In-Network for one plan may not
be In-Network for another. Be sure to check your Identification Card or call Member Services to find out
which network this Plan uses.
</p>
<p>Continuity of Care
</p>
<p>If your In-Network Provider leaves our network because we have terminated their contract without cause,
and you are in active treatment, you may be able to continue seeing that Provider for a limited period of
time and still get In-Network benefits. &ldquo;Active treatment&rdquo; includes:
</p>
<p>1) An ongoing course of treatment for a life-threatening condition,
</p>
<p>2) An ongoing course of treatment for a serious acute condition, (examples include chemotherapy,
radiation therapy and post-operative visits),
</p>
<p>3) The second or third trimester of pregnancy and through the postpartum period; or</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>42
</p>
<p>4) An ongoing course of treatment for a health condition for which the Physician or health care Provider
attests that discontinuing care by the current Physician or Provider would worsen your condition or
interfere with anticipated outcomes. An &ldquo;ongoing course of treatment&rdquo; includes treatments for mental
health and substance use disorders.
</p>
<p>In these cases, you may be able to continue seeing that Provider for up to 90 days. If treatment is not
complete at the end of 90 days, you may, depending on the condition be entitled to a longer period as
allowed by law. If you wish to continue seeing the same Provider, you or your Doctor should contact
Member Services for details.
</p>
<p>Crediting Prior Plan Coverage
</p>
<p>If you were covered by the Group&rsquo;s prior carrier / plan within 31 days before the Group&rsquo;s coverage
became effective with us, then you will get credit for any accrued Deductible and, if applicable and
approved by us, Out of Pocket amounts for claims incurred within 90 days of the effective date of this
Plan. This does not apply to claims incurred prior to the current Benefit Period, or to people who were not
covered by the prior carrier or plan on the day before the Group&rsquo;s coverage with us began, or to people
who join the Group later.
</p>
<p>If your Group moves from one of our plans to another, (for example, changes its coverage from HMO to
PPO), and you were covered by the other product immediately before enrolling in this product with no
break in coverage, then you may get credit for any accrued Deductible and Out of Pocket amounts, if
applicable and approved by us. Any maximums, when applicable, will be carried over and charged
against the maximums under this Plan.
</p>
<p>If your Group offers more than one of our products, and you change from one product to another with no
break in coverage, you will get credit for any accrued Deductible and, if applicable, Out of Pocket
amounts and any maximums will be carried over and charged against maximums under this Plan.

<p>The BlueCard Program
</p>
<p>Like all Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield plans throughout the country, we participate in a program called
"BlueCard", which provides services to you when you are outside our Service Area. For more details on
this program, please see &ldquo;Inter-Plan Arrangements&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Claims Procedure (How to File a Claims)&rdquo;
section.</p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>Identification Card
</p>
<p>We will give an Identification Card to each Member enrolled in the Plan. When you get care, you must
show your Identification Card. Only a Member who has paid the Premiums for this Plan has the right to
services or benefits under this Booklet. If anyone gets services or benefits to which they are not entitled to
under the terms of this Booklet, he/she must pay for the actual cost of the services.
</p>
<p>Getting Approval for Benefits
</p>
<p>Your Plan includes the process of Utilization Review to decide when services are Medically Necessary or
Experimental/Investigational as those terms are defined in this Booklet. Utilization Review aids the
delivery of cost-effective health care by reviewing the use of treatments and, when proper, level of care
and/or the setting or place of service that they are performed. A service must be Medically Necessary to
be a Covered Service. When level of care, setting or place of service is part of the review, services that
can be safely given to you in a lower level of care or lower cost setting / place of care, will not be
Medically Necessary if they are given in a higher level of care, or higher cost setting / place of care.
</p>
<p>Certain Services must be reviewed to determine Medical Necessity in order for you to get benefits.
Utilization Review criteria will be based on many sources including medical policy and clinical guidelines.
HMO Colorado may decide that a service that was asked for is not Medically Necessary if you have not
tried other treatments that are more cost effective.
</p>
<p>If you have any questions about the information in this section, you may call the Member Services phone
number on the back of your Identification Card.
</p>
<p>Coverage for or payment of the service or treatment reviewed is not guaranteed even if we decide
your services are Medically Necessary. For benefits to be covered, we may consider on the date
you get service:
</p>
<p>1. You must be eligible for benefits;
</p>
<p>2. Premium must be paid for the time period that services are given;
</p>
<p>3. The service or supply must be the same as was precertified;
</p>
<p>4. The service or supply must be for the same condition and setting that was precertified; and
</p>
<p>5. You must not have exceeded any applicable limits under your Plan.
</p>
<p>Types of Reviews
</p>
<p>&middot; Pre-service Review &ndash; A review of a service, treatment or admission for a coverage determination
which is done before the service or treatment begins or admission date.
</p>
<p>&middot; Precertification &ndash; A required Pre-service Review for a benefit coverage determination for a service
or treatment. Certain services require Precertification in order for you to get benefits. The benefit
coverage review will include a review to decide whether the service meets the definition of Medical
Necessity or is Experimental / Investigational as those terms are defined in this Booklet.
</p>
<p>For emergency services, Precertification is not required. For admissions following Emergency Care,
you, your authorized representative or Doctor must tell us within 72 hours of the admission or as soon
as possible within a reasonable period of time. For childbirth admissions, Precertification is not
needed unless the admission lasts beyond the first 48 hours for a vaginal delivery or 96 hours for a
cesarean delivery, or if the baby is not sent home at the same time as the mother.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>44
</p>
<p>&middot; Continued Stay / Concurrent Review - A Utilization Review of a service, treatment or admission for
a benefit coverage determination which must be done during an ongoing stay in a facility or course of
treatment.
</p>
<p>Both Pre-Service and Continued Stay / Concurrent Reviews may be considered on an urgent or
expedited timeframe when, in the view of the treating Provider or any Doctor with knowledge of your
medical condition, without such care or treatment, your life or health or your ability to regain maximum
function could be seriously threatened or you could be subjected to severe pain that cannot be
adequately managed without such care or treatment, or if you have a physical or mental disability, would
create an imminent and substantial limitation on your existing ability to live independently. Urgent reviews
are conducted under a shorter timeframe than standard reviews.
</p>
<p>&middot; Post-service Review &ndash; A review of a service, treatment or admission for a benefit coverage that is
conducted after the service has been provided. Post-service reviews are performed when a service,
treatment or admission did not need a Precertification, or when a needed Precertification was not
obtained. Post-service reviews are done for a service, treatment or admission in which we have a
related clinical coverage guideline and are typically initiated by us.
</p>
<p>Who is Responsible for Precertification?
</p>
<p>Typically, In-Network Providers know which services need Precertification and will get any Precertification
when needed. Your Primary Care Physician / Provider and other In-Network Providers have been given
detailed information about these procedures and in Colorado are responsible for meeting these
requirements. Generally, the ordering Provider, Facility or attending Doctor (&ldquo;requesting Provider&rdquo;) will get
in touch with us to ask for a Precertification. However, you may request a Precertification or you may
choose an authorized representative to act on your behalf for a specific request. The authorized
representative can be anyone who is 18 years of age or older. The table below outlines who is
responsible for Precertification and under what circumstances. To get more information on what services
need Precertification, you or your representative may call Member Services.

<p>How Decisions are Made
</p>
<p>We use our clinical coverage guidelines, such as medical policy, clinical guidelines, and other applicable
policies and procedures to help make our Medical Necessity decisions. This includes decisions about
Prescription Drugs as detailed in the section &ldquo;Prescription Drugs Administered by a Medical Provider&rdquo;.
Medical policies and clinical guidelines reflect the standards of practice and medical interventions
identified as proper medical practice. We reserve the right to review and update these clinical coverage
guidelines from time to time.</p>

</p>
<p>We will review requests for benefits according to the timeframes listed below. The timeframes and
requirements listed are based on state and federal laws. Where state laws are stricter than federal laws,
we will follow state laws. If you live in and/or get services in a state other than the state where your
Contract was issued other state-specific requirements may apply.  You may call the phone number on the
back of your Identification Card for more details.

<p>We will notify you and your Provider of our decision as required by state and federal law. Notice may be
given by one or more of the following methods: verbal, written, and/or electronic.
</p>
<p>Important Information
</p>
<p>HMO Colorado may, from time to time, waive, enhance, change or end certain medical management
processes (including utilization management, case management, and disease management) and/or offer
an alternate benefit if in our sole discretion, such change furthers the provision of cost effective, value
based and/or quality services.
</p>
<p>We may also select certain qualifying Providers to take part in a program that exempts them from certain
procedural or medical management processes that would otherwise apply. We may also exempt your
claim from medical review if certain conditions apply.
</p>
<p>Just because HMO Colorado exempts a process, Provider or Claim from the standards which otherwise
would apply, it does not mean that HMO Colorado will do so in the future, or will do so in the future for</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>47
</p>
<p>any other Provider, claim or Member. HMO Colorado may stop or change any such exemption with or
without advance notice.
</p>
<p>You may find out whether a Provider is taking part in certain programs by checking your on-line Provider
Directory, on-line pre-certification list or contacting the Member Services number on the back of your
Identification Card.
</p>
<p>We also may identify certain Providers to review for potential fraud, waste, abuse or other inappropriate
activity if the claims data suggests there may be inappropriate billing practices. If a Provider is selected
under this program, then we may use one or more clinical utilization management guidelines in the review
of claims submitted by this Provider, even if those guidelines are not used for all Providers delivering
services to this Plan&rsquo;s Members.
</p>
<p>Health Plan Individual Case Management
</p>
<p>Our health plan individual case management programs (Case Management) help coordinate services for
Members with health care needs due to serious, complex, and/or chronic health conditions. Our
programs coordinate benefits and educate Members who agree to take part in the Case Management
program to help meet their health-related needs.
</p>
<p>Our Case Management programs are confidential and voluntary and are made available at no extra cost
to you. These programs are provided by, or on behalf of and at the request of, your health plan case
management staff. These Case Management programs are separate from any Covered Services you are
receiving.
</p>
<p>If you meet program criteria and agree to take part, we will help you meet your identified health care
needs. This is reached through contact and team work with you and/or your chosen authorized
representative, treating Doctor(s), and other Providers.
</p>
<p>In addition, we may assist in coordinating care with existing community-based programs and services to
meet your needs. This may include giving you information about external agencies and community-
based programs and services.
</p>
<p>In certain cases of severe or chronic illness or injury, we may provide benefits for alternate care that is not
listed as a Covered Service. We may also extend Covered Services beyond the Benefit Maximums of this
Plan. We will make our decision case-by-case, if in our discretion the alternate or extended benefit is in
the best interest of you and HMO Colorado and you or your authorized representative agree to the
alternate or extended benefit in writing. A decision to provide extended benefits or approve alternate care
in one case does not obligate us to provide the same benefits again to you or to any other Member. We
reserve the right, at any time, to alter or stop providing extended benefits or approving alternate care. In
such case, we will notify you or your authorized representative in writing.</p>

<p>Section 7. Benefits/Coverage (What is Covered)
This section describes the Covered Services available under your Plan. Covered Services are subject to
all the terms and conditions listed in this Booklet, including, but not limited to, Benefit Maximums,
Deductibles, Copayments, Coinsurance, Exclusions and Medical Necessity requirements. Please read
the &ldquo;Schedule of Benefits (Who Pays What)" for details on the amounts you must pay for Covered
Services and for details on any Benefit Maximums. Also be sure to read "How to Access Your Services
and Obtain Approval of Benefits (Applicable to managed care plans)" for more information on your Plan&rsquo;s
rules. Read the &ldquo;Limitations/Exclusions (What is Not Covered)&rdquo; section for important details on Excluded
Services.
</p>
<p>Your benefits are described below. Benefits are listed alphabetically to make them easy to find. Please
note that several sections may apply to your claims. For example, if you have surgery, benefits for your
Hospital stay will be described under &ldquo;Inpatient Hospital Care&rdquo; and benefits for your Doctor&rsquo;s services will
be described under &ldquo;Inpatient Professional Services&rdquo;. As a result, you should read all sections that might
apply to your claims.
</p>
<p>You should also know that many of Covered Services can be received in several settings, including a
Doctor&rsquo;s office, an Urgent Care Facility, an Outpatient Facility, or an Inpatient Facility. Benefits will often
vary depending on where you choose to get Covered Services, and this can result in a change in the
amount you need to pay. Please see the &ldquo;Schedule of Benefits (Who Pays What)&rdquo; for more details on
how benefits vary in each setting.
</p>
<p>Please note that care must be received from your Primary Care Physician (PCP) or another In-
Network Provider to be a Covered Service under this Plan. If you use an Out-of-Network Provider,
your entire claim will be denied unless:
</p>
<p>&middot; The services are for Emergency Care; or
</p>
<p>&middot; The services are approved in advance by HMO Colorado as an Authorized Service.
</p>
<p>Acupuncture/Nerve Pathway Therapy
</p>
<p>Please see &ldquo;Therapy Services&rdquo; later in this section.
</p>
<p>Allergy Services
</p>
<p>Your Plan includes benefits for Medically Necessary allergy testing and treatment, including allergy serum
and allergy shots.
</p>
<p>Ambulance Services
</p>
<p>Medically Necessary ambulance services are a Covered Service when one or more of the following
criteria are met:
</p>
<p>&middot; You are transported by a state licensed vehicle that is designed, equipped, and used only to transport
the sick and injured and staffed by Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT), paramedics, or other
certified medical professionals. This includes ground, water, fixed wing, and rotary wing air
transportation.
</p>
<p>&middot; For ground ambulance, you are taken:
</p>
<p>- From your home, the scene of an accident or medical Emergency to a Hospital;</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>49
</p>
<p>- Between Hospitals, including when we require you to move from an Out-of-Network Hospital to
an In-Network Hospital;
</p>
<p>- Between a Hospital and a Skilled Nursing Facility or other approved Facility.
</p>
<p>&middot; For air or water ambulance, you are taken:
</p>
<p>- From the scene of an accident or medical Emergency to a Hospital;
</p>
<p>- Between Hospitals, including when we require you to move from an Out-of-Network Hospital to
an In-Network Hospital
</p>
<p>- Between a Hospital and an approved Facility.
</p>
<p>Ambulance services are subject to Medical Necessity reviews by us. Emergency ground ambulance
services do not require Precertification and are allowed regardless of whether the Provider is an In-
Network or Out-of-Network Provider. For Emergency ambulance services performed by an Out-of-
Network Provider you do not need to pay any more than would have been paid for services from an In-
Network Provider.
</p>
<p>Non-Emergency ambulance services are subject to Medical Necessity reviews by us. When using an air
ambulance for non-Emergency transportation, we reserve the right to select the air ambulance Provider. If
you do not use the air ambulance Provider we select, no benefits will be available. Please see the
&ldquo;Schedule of Benefits (Who Pays What)&rdquo; for the maximum benefit.
</p>
<p>You must be taken to the nearest Facility that can give care for your condition. In certain cases we may
approve benefits for transportation to a Facility that is not the nearest Facility.
</p>
<p>Benefits also include Medically Necessary treatment of a sickness or injury by medical professionals from
an ambulance service, even if you are not taken to a Facility.
</p>
<p>Ambulance services are not covered when another type of transportation can be used without
endangering your health. Ambulance services for your convenience or the convenience of your family or
Doctor are not a Covered Service.
</p>
<p>Other non-covered ambulance services include, but are not limited to, trips to:
</p>
<p>&middot; A Doctor&rsquo;s office or clinic;
&middot; A morgue or funeral home.
</p>
<p>Important Notes on Air Ambulance Benefits
</p>
<p>Benefits are only available for air ambulance when it is not appropriate to use a ground or water
ambulance. For example, if using a ground ambulance would endanger your health and your medical
condition requires a more rapid transport to a Facility than the ground ambulance can provide, the Plan
will cover the air ambulance. Air ambulance will also be covered if you are in an area that a ground or
water ambulance cannot reach.
</p>
<p>Air ambulance will not be covered if you are taken to a Hospital that is not an acute care Hospital (such
as a Skilled Nursing Facility), or if you are taken to a Physician&rsquo;s office or your home.
</p>
<p>Hospital to Hospital Transport
</p>
<p>If you are moving from one Hospital to another, air ambulance will only be covered if using a ground
ambulance would endanger your health and if the Hospital that first treats cannot give you the medical
services you need. Certain specialized services are not available at all Hospitals. For example, burn
care, cardiac care, trauma care, and critical care are only available at certain Hospitals. To be covered,</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>50
</p>
<p>you must be taken to the closest Hospital that can treat you. Coverage is not available for air
ambulance transfers simply because you, your family, or your Provider prefers a specific Hospital
or Physician.
</p>
<p>Autism Services
</p>
<p>Covered Services are provided for the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of Autism Spectrum
Disorders (ASD). See the &ldquo;Schedule of Benefits (Who Pays What)&rdquo; for age limitations associated with
Applied Behavior Analysis. The following treatments will not be considered Experimental or
Investigational and will be considered appropriate, effective, or efficient for the treatment of Autism
Spectrum Disorders where We determine such services are Medically Necessary:
</p>
<p>&middot; Evaluation and assessment services;
</p>
<p>&middot; Behavior training and behavior management and Applied Behavior Analysis, including but not limited
to consultations, direct care, supervision, or treatment, or any combination thereof, for Autism
Spectrum Disorders provided by Autism Services Providers;
</p>
<p>&middot; Habilitative or rehabilitative care, including, but not limited to, occupational therapy, physical therapy,
or speech therapy, or any combination of those therapies;
</p>
<p>&middot; Prescription Drugs;
</p>
<p>&middot; Psychiatric care;
</p>
<p>&middot; Psychological care, including family counseling; and
</p>
<p>&middot; Therapeutic care.
</p>
<p>Treatment for Autism Spectrum Disorders must be prescribed or ordered by a Doctor or psychologist, and
services must be provided by a Provider covered under this Plan and approved to provide those services.
However, behavior training, behavior management, or Applied Behavior Analysis services (whether
provided directly or as part of Therapeutic Care), must be provided by an Autism Services Provider.
Coverage of Autism Spectrum Disorders in this section is in addition to coverage provided for early
intervention and Congenital Defects and Birth Abnormality. Autism services and the Autism Treatment
Plan are subject to review under the &ldquo;How to Access Your Services and Obtain Approval of Benefits
(Applicable to managed care plans)&rdquo; section.

</p>
<p>Clinical Trials
</p>
<p>Benefits include coverage for services, such as routine patient care costs, given to you as a participant in
an approved clinical trial if the services are Covered Services under this Plan. An &ldquo;approved clinical trial&rdquo;
means a phase I, phase II, phase III, or phase IV clinical trial that studies the prevention, detection, or
treatment of cancer or other life-threatening conditions. The term life-threatening condition means any
disease or condition from which death is likely unless the disease or condition is treated.
</p>
<p>Benefits are limited to the following trials:
</p>
<p>1. Federally funded trials approved or funded by one of the following:
</p>
<p>a. The National Institutes of Health.
</p>
<p>b. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</p>
<p>c. The Agency for Health Care Research and Quality.

Institutes of Health for center support grants.
</p>
<p>g. Any of the following in i-iii below if the study or investigation has been reviewed and approved
through a system of peer review that the Secretary of Health and Human Services determines 1)
to be comparable to the system of peer review of studies and investigations used by the National
Institutes of Health, and 2) assures unbiased review of the highest scientific standards by
qualified individuals who have no interest in the outcome of the review.
</p>
<p>i. The Department of Veterans Affairs.
</p>
<p>ii. The Department of Defense.
</p>
<p>iii. The Department of Energy.
</p>
<p>2. Studies or investigations done as part of an investigational new drug application reviewed by the
Food and Drug Administration;
</p>
<p>3. Studies or investigations done for drug trials which are exempt from the investigational new drug
application.
</p>
<p>Your Plan may require you to use an In-Network Provider to maximize your benefits.
</p>
<p>Routine patient care costs include items, services, and drugs provided to you in connection with an
approved clinical trial that would otherwise be covered by this Plan.
</p>
<p>All requests for clinical trials services, including services that are not part of approved clinical trials, will be
reviewed according to our Clinical Coverage Guidelines, related policies and procedures.
</p>
<p>Your Plan is not required to provide benefits for the following services. We reserve our right to exclude
any of the following services:
</p>
<p>i. The Investigational item, device, or service; or
</p>
<p>ii. Items and services that are given only to satisfy data collection and analysis needs and that are not
used in the direct clinical management of the patient; or</p>

</p>
<p>Dental Services
</p>
<p>Your Dental Benefits
Dental care treatment decisions are made by you and your dentist. We cover treatment based on what
benefits you have, not whether the care is medically or dentally necessary. The only exception is when
you get orthodontic care &ndash; we do review those services to make sure they are appropriate.
</p>
<p>Pretreatment Estimates
When you need major dental care, like crowns, root canals, dentures/bridges, oral surgery, or braces &mdash; it
is best to go over a care or treatment plan with your dentist beforehand. It should include a &ldquo;pretreatment
estimate&rdquo; so you know what it will cost.
</p>
<p>You or your dentist can send us the pretreatment estimate to get an idea of how much of the cost your
benefits will cover. Then you can work with your dentist to make financial arrangements, before you start
treatment.
</p>
<p>Dental Providers
</p>
<p>Every plan has a network of dentists to choose from. You can go to any dentist, whether they are in your
network or not. But you will almost always pay less for the same level of care if you see a dentist in your
network. Also, dentists in your network will send claims for care directly to us. When you go out of
network, you may have to pay up front &mdash; then you would submit claims to us for reimbursement.
</p>
<p>For help finding a dentist in your network, log in to anthem.com/mydentalvision and go to Find a Doctor.
When it asks for the type of doctor, choose dentist. You can also call the Member Services number on
your dental Identification Card for help.
</p>
<p>Pediatric Dental Covered Services
</p>

Orthodontic care is the prevention and correction of malocclusion of teeth and associated dental and
facial disharmonies, including conditions such as cleft lip and cleft palate. Talk to your dental provider
about getting a pretreatment estimate for your orthodontic treatment plan, so you have an idea upfront
about what the treatment and costs will be. You or your dental provider should send it to us so we can
help you understand how much is covered by your benefits.
</p>
<p>Note: For adult orthodontic services for cleft lip and cleft palate conditions, see the Dental Services (All
Members / All Ages) description.
</p>
<p>Dentally Necessary Orthodontic Care
</p>
<p>This plan will only cover orthodontic care that is dentally necessary &ndash; at least one of these criteria must be
present:
</p>
<p>&middot; Spacing between adjacent teeth which interferes with the biting function;
</p>
<p>&middot; Overbite that causes the lower front (anterior) teeth to impinge on the roof of your mouth when you
bite;
</p>
<p>&middot; The position of your jaw or teeth impairs your ability to bite or chew; or
</p>
<p>&middot; On an objective professionally orthodontic severity index, your condition scores consistent with
needing orthodontic care.
</p>
<p>What Orthodontic Care Includes. Orthodontic care may include the following types of treatment:
</p>
<p>&middot; Limited Treatment. A treatment usually given for minor tooth movement and is not a full treatment
case.
</p>
<p>&middot; Interceptive Treatment (also known as limited phase I treatment). This is a limited treatment that is
used to prevent or lessen the need for more involved treatment in the future.
</p>
<p>&middot; Comprehensive or Complete Treatment. A full kind of treatment that includes all radiographs,
diagnostic casts and models, orthodontic appliances and office visits.
</p>
<p>&middot; Removable Appliance Therapy. Treatment that uses an appliance that is removable and not
cemented or bonded to the teeth.
</p>
<p>&middot; Fixed Appliance Therapy. Treatment that uses an appliance that is cemented or bonded to the teeth.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>55
</p>
<p>Complex Surgical Procedures. Surgical procedures given for orthodontic reasons, such as exposing
impacted or unerupted teeth for repositioning of teeth.
</p>
<p>How We Pay for Orthodontic Care
</p>
<p>Because orthodontic treatment usually occurs over a long period of time, payments are made over the
course of your treatment. In order for us to continue to pay for your orthodontic care, you must have
continuous coverage under this Plan.
</p>
<p>The first payment for orthodontic care is made when treatment begins. Treatment begins when the
appliances are installed. Your dental provider should submit the necessary forms telling us when your
appliance is installed. Payments are then made at six month intervals until the treatment is finished or
your coverage under this Plan ends.
</p>
<p>If your orthodontic treatment is already in progress (the appliance has been installed) when you begin
coverage under this Plan, the treatment benefit under this coverage will be on a pro-rated basis. We will
only cover the portion of the orthodontic treatment that you are given while covered under this Plan. We
will not pay for any portion or your treatment that was given before your Effective Date under this Plan.
</p>
<p>What Orthodontic Care Does NOT Include, unless for Medically Necessary care for cleft palate and
cleft lip conditions as provided by this Booklet. The following is not covered as part of your orthodontic
treatment:

of treatment.
</p>
<p>&middot; Repair or replacement of lost, broken or stolen appliances.

<p>Benefits are available within the HMO Service Area and outside the HMO service area in a Hospital
Emergency Room for services and supplies to treat the onset of symptoms, screen and stabilize an
Emergency, which is defined below.
</p>
<p>Emergency (Emergency Medical Condition)
</p>
<p>Emergency,&rdquo;&rdquo; or &ldquo;Emergency Medical Condition&rdquo; means a medical or behavioral health condition of recent
onset and sufficient severity, including but not limited to, severe pain, that would lead a prudent
layperson, possessing an average knowledge of medicine and health, to believe that his or her condition,
sickness, or injury is of such a nature that not getting immediate medical care could result in: (a) placing
the patient&rsquo;s health or the health of another person in serious danger or, for a pregnant women, placing
the women&rsquo;s health or the health of her unborn child in serious danger; (b) serious impairment to bodily
functions; or (c) serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part. Such conditions include but are not
limited to, chest pain, stroke, poisoning, serious breathing problems, unconsciousness, severe burns or
cuts, uncontrolled bleeding, or seizures and such other acute conditions as may be determined to be
Emergencies by us.
</p>
<p>Emergency Care
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Emergency Care&rdquo; means a medical or behavioral health exam done in the Emergency Department of a
Hospital, and includes services routinely available in the Emergency Department to evaluate an
Emergency Condition. It includes any further medical or behavioral health exams and treatment required
to stabilize the patient.
</p>
<p>With respect to an Emergency, stabilize means to provide such medical treatment of the condition as may
be necessary to assure, within reasonable medical probability, that no material deterioration of the
condition is likely to result from or occur during the transfer of the Member from a facility. With respect to
a pregnant woman who is having contractions, the term &ldquo;stabilize&rdquo; also means to deliver (including the
placenta), if there is inadequate time to effect a safe transfer to another Hospital before delivery or
transfer may pose a threat to the health or safety of the woman or the unborn child.
</p>
<p>Medically Necessary services will be covered whether you get care from an In-Network or Out-of-Network
Provider. Emergency Care you get from an Out-of-Network Provider will be covered as an In-Network
service, you will not need to pay more than what you would have if you had seen an In-Network Provider.
</p>
<p>If you are admitted to the Hospital from the Emergency Room, be sure that you or your Doctor calls us as
soon as possible. We will review your care to decide if a Hospital stay is needed and how many days you
should stay. See &ldquo;How to Access Your Services and Obtain Approval of Benefits (Applicable to managed
care plans)&rdquo; for more details. If you or your Doctor do not call us, you may have to pay for services that
are determined to be not Medically Necessary.
</p>
<p>Treatment you get after your condition has stabilized is not Emergency Care. If you continue to get care
from an Out-of-Network Provider, Covered Services will not be available unless we agree to cover them
as an Authorized Service.

<p>Prior Approval and Precertification
</p>
<p>To best understand your benefits, you may call our Transplant Department to discuss benefit coverage
when it is determined a transplant may be needed. We suggest you do this before you have an evaluation
and/or work-up for a transplant, so that we can assist you in maximizing your benefits. To learn more or to
find out which Hospitals are In-Network Transplant Providers, You may contact the Member Services
telephone number on the back of your Identification Card and ask for the transplant coordinator. In
addition, you or your Provider must call our Transplant Department for Precertification prior to the
transplant, whether this is performed in an Inpatient or Outpatient setting.
</p>
<p>Precertification is required before we will cover benefits for a transplant. Your Doctor must certify, and we
must agree, that the transplant is Medically Necessary. Your Doctor should send a written request for
Precertification to us as soon as possible to start this process. Not getting Precertification will result in a
denial of benefits.
</p>
<p>Please note that there are cases where your Provider asks for approval for Human Leukocyte Antigen
(HLA) testing, donor searches and/or a collection and storage of stem cells prior to the final decision as to
what transplant procedure will be needed. In these cases, the HLA testing and donor search charges will
be covered as routine diagnostic tests. The collection and storage request will be reviewed for Medical
Necessity and may be approved. However, such an approval for HLA testing, donor search and/or
collection and storage is NOT an approval for the later transplant. A separate Medical Necessity decision
will be needed for the transplant.
</p>

any case, as provided by federal law, we may not require a Provider to get authorization from us before

of a doctor&rsquo;s visit, home care visit, or at an outpatient Facility when they are Covered Services. This may
include Drugs for infusion therapy, chemotherapy, blood products, certain injectables, and any Drug that

Benefits for those Drugs are described in the &ldquo;Prescription Drug Benefit at a Retail or Home Delivery (Mail
Order) Pharmacy&rdquo; section.
</p>
<p>Important Details About Prescription Drug Coverage
</p>
<p>Your Plan includes certain features to determine when Prescription Drugs should be covered, which are
described below. As part of these features, your prescribing Doctor may be asked to give more details
before we can decide if the Drug is eligible for coverage. In order to determine if the Prescription Drug is
eligible for coverage, we have established criteria.
</p>
<p>The criteria, which are called drug edits, may include requirements regarding one or more of the
following:
</p>
<p>&middot; Quantity, dose, and frequency of administration,
</p>
<p>&middot; Specific clinical criteria including, but not limited to, requirements regarding age, test result
requirements, and/or presence of a specific condition or disease,
</p>
<p>&middot; Specific Provider qualifications including, but not limited to, REMS certification (Risk, Evaluation and
Mitigation Strategies),
</p>
<p>&middot; Step therapy requiring one Drug or a Drug regimen or another treatment be used prior to use of
another Drug or Drug regimen for safety and/or affordability when clinically similar results may be
anticipated and one option is less costly than another,
</p>
<p>&middot; Use of an Anthem Prescription Drug List (a formulary developed by Anthem) which is a list of FDA-
approved Drugs that have been reviewed and recommended for use based on their quality and cost
effectiveness.
</p>
<p>Precertification
</p>
<p>Precertification may be required for certain Prescription Drugs to help make sure proper use and
guidelines for Prescription Drug coverage are followed. We will give the results of our decision to both
you and your Provider.
</p>
<p>For a list of Prescription Drugs that need Precertification, please call the phone number on the back of
your Identification Card. The list will be reviewed and updated from time to time. Including a Prescription
Drug or related item on the list does not guarantee coverage under your Plan. Your Provider may check
with us to verify Prescription Drug coverage, to find out which drugs are covered under this section and if
any drug edits apply.
</p>
<p>Expedited Precertification &ndash; We will review Expedited requests for Precertification of Prescription Drugs
according to the timeframes listed below:
</p>
<p>&middot; If all needed information is provided with the request, we will approve or deny it within one business
day of receiving the request, unless a shorter period of time is required by law;</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>77
</p>
<p>&middot; If we need more information to make a decision, we will tell the prescribing Provider what information
is needed within one business day of receiving the request. If the information is timely provided, we
will make a decision within the timeframes provided by law;
</p>
<p>&middot; If the prescribing Provider does not supply the requested information within two business days of
receiving our request, the Precertification request will be deemed denied.
</p>
<p>Non-Expedited Precertification &ndash; We will review non-Expedited requests for Precertification of
Prescription Drugs according to the timeframes listed below:
</p>
<p>&middot; If all needed information is provided with the request, we approve or deny it within two business days
of receiving the request;
</p>
<p>&middot; If we need more information to make a decision, we will tell the prescribing Provider what information
is needed within two business days of receiving the request. If the information is timely provided, we
will make a decision within the timeframes provided by law;
</p>
<p>&middot; If the prescribing Provider does not supply the requested information within two business days of
receiving our request, the request will be deemed denied.
</p>
<p>Note: If we do not request additional information or provide notification of approval or denial as required
by applicable law, the request will be deemed approved. We will give notice of our decision as required by
state and federal law.
</p>
<p>Please refer to the section &ldquo;How to Access Your Services and Obtain Approval of Benefits (Applicable to
managed care plans)&rdquo; under &ldquo;Getting Approval for Benefits&rdquo; for more details.

Complaints&rdquo; section of this Booklet.
</p>
<p>Therapeutic Substitution
</p>
<p>Therapeutic substitution is an optional program that tells you and your Doctors about alternatives to
certain prescribed Drugs. We may contact you and your Doctor to make you aware of these choices.
Only you and your Doctor can determine if the therapeutic substitute is right for you. For questions or
issues about therapeutic Drug substitutes, call Member Services at the phone number on the back of your
Identification Card.
</p>
<p>Prescription Drug Benefit at a Retail or Home Delivery (Mail Order)
Pharmacy
</p>
<p>Your Plan also includes benefits for Prescription Drugs you get at a Retail or Mail Order Pharmacy. We
use a Pharmacy Benefits Manager (PBM) to manage these benefits. The PBM has a network of Retail
Pharmacies, a Home Delivery (Mail Order) Pharmacy, and a Specialty Pharmacy. The PBM works to
make sure Drugs are used properly. This includes checking that Prescriptions are based on recognized
and appropriate doses and checking for Drug interactions or pregnancy concerns.
</p>
<p>Please note: Benefits for Prescription Drugs, including Specialty Drugs, which are administered to you by
a medical Provider in a medical setting (e.g., doctor&rsquo;s office visit, home care visit, or outpatient Facility)
are covered under the &ldquo;Prescription Drugs Administered by a Medical Provider&rdquo; benefit. Please read that
section for important details.</p>

<p>Prescription Drug Benefits
</p>
<p>Prescription Drug benefits may require prior authorization to determine if your Drugs should be covered.
Your In-Network Pharmacist will be told if prior authorization is required and if any additional details are
needed for us to decide benefits.
</p>
<p>Prior Authorization
</p>
<p>Prescribing Providers must obtain prior authorization in order for you to get benefits for certain Drugs. At
times, your Provider will initiate a prior authorization on your behalf before your Pharmacy fills your
Prescription. At other times, the Pharmacy may make you or your Provider aware that a prior
authorization or other information is needed. In order to determine if the Prescription drug is eligible for
coverage, we have established criteria.
</p>
<p>The criteria, which are called drug edits, may include requirements regarding one or more of the
following:
</p>
<p>&middot; Quantity, dose, and frequency of administration,
</p>

Services at the phone number on the back of your Identification Card or check our website at

us to verify Prescription Drug coverage, to find out which drugs are covered under this section and if any
drug edits apply.
</p>
<p>HMO Colorado may, from time to time, waive, enhance, change or end certain prior authorization and/or

based and/or quality services.

<p>Where You Can Get Prescription Drugs
</p>
<p>In-Network Pharmacy
</p>
<p>You can visit one of the local Retail Pharmacies in our network. Give the Pharmacy the prescription from
your Doctor and your Identification Card and they will file your claim for you. You will need to pay any
Copayment, Coinsurance, and/or Deductible that applies when you get the Drug. If you do not have your
Identification Card, the Pharmacy will charge you the full retail price of the Prescription and will not be
able to file the claim for you. You will need to ask the Pharmacy for a detailed receipt and send it to us
with a written request for payment.
</p>
<p>Important Note: If we determine that you may be using Prescription Drugs in a harmful or abusive
manner, or with harmful frequency, your selection of In-Network Pharmacies may be limited. If this
happens, we may require you to select a single In-Network Pharmacy that will provide and coordinate all
future pharmacy services. Benefits will only be paid if you use the single In-Network Pharmacy. We will
contact you if we determine that use of a single In-Network Pharmacy is needed and give you options as
to which In-Network Pharmacy you may use. If you do not select one of the In-Network Pharmacies we
offer within 31 days, we will select a single In-Network Pharmacy for you. If you disagree with our
decision, you may ask us to reconsider it as outlined in the &ldquo;Appeals and Complaints&rdquo; section of this
Booklet.
</p>
<p>Maintenance Pharmacy
</p>
<p>You may also obtain a 90-day supply of Maintenance Medications from a Maintenance Pharmacy. A
Maintenance Medication is a Drug you take on a regular basis to treat or control a chronic illness such as
heart disease, high blood pressure, epilepsy, or diabetes. If you are not sure the Prescription Drug you
are taking is a Maintenance Medication or need to determine if your Pharmacy is a Maintenance
Pharmacy, please call Member Services at the number on the back of your Identification Card or check
our website at www.anthem.com for more details.
</p>
<p>Incentive Choice
</p>
<p>Your Plan has two levels of coverage. To get the lowest out-of-pocket cost, you must get Covered
Services from a Level 1 In-Network Pharmacy. If you get Covered Services from any other In-Network
Pharmacy, benefits will be covered at Level 2 and you may pay more in Deductible, Copayments, and
Coinsurance.
</p>
<p>Level 1 In-Network Pharmacies. When you go to Level 1 In-Network Pharmacies, (also referred to as
Core Pharmacies), you pay a lower Copayment / Coinsurance on Covered Services than when you go to
other In-Network Providers.
</p>
<p>Level 2 In-Network Pharmacies. When you go to Level 2 In-Network Pharmacies, (also referred to as
Wrap Pharmacies), you pay a higher Copayment / Coinsurance on Covered Services than when you go
to a Level 1 In-Network Pharmacy.</p>

<p>Specialty Pharmacy
</p>
<p>We keep a list of Specialty Drugs that may be covered based upon clinical findings from the Pharmacy
and Therapeutics (P&amp;T) Process, and where appropriate, certain clinical economic reasons.  This list will
change from time to time. We may require you or your doctor to order certain Specialty Drugs from the
PBM&rsquo;s Specialty Pharmacy.
</p>
<p>When you use the PBM&rsquo;s Specialty Pharmacy, its patient care coordinator will work with you and your
Doctor to get prior authorization and to ship your Specialty Drugs to your home or your preferred address.
Your patient care coordinator will also tell you when it is time to refill your prescription.
</p>
<p>You can get the list of covered Specialty Drugs by calling Member Services at the phone number on the
back of your Identification Card or check our website at www.anthem.com.
</p>
<p>Home Delivery Pharmacy
</p>
<p>The PBM also has a Home Delivery Pharmacy which lets you get certain Drugs by mail if you take them
on a regular basis. You will need to contact the PBM to sign up when you first use the service. You can
mail written prescriptions from your Doctor or have your Doctor send the prescription to the Home
Delivery Pharmacy. Your Doctor may also call the Home Delivery Pharmacy. You will need to send in
any Copayments, Deductible, or Coinsurance amounts that apply when you ask for a prescription or refill.
</p>

that have been reviewed and recommended for use based on their quality and cost effectiveness.
Benefits may not be covered for certain Drugs if they are not on the Prescription Drug List.
</p>
<p>The Drug List is developed by us based upon clinical findings, and where proper, the cost of the Drug
relative to other Drugs in its therapeutic class or used to treat the same or similar condition. It is also
based on the availability of over the counter medicines, Generic Drugs, the use of one Drug over another
by our Members, and where proper, certain clinical economic reasons.
</p>
<p>We retain the right, at our discretion, to decide coverage for doses and administration methods (i.e., oral,
injection, topical, or inhaled) and may cover one form of administration instead of another as Medically
Necessary.
</p>
<p>Exception Request for a Drug not on the Prescription Drug List
</p>
<p>If you, your designee or your Doctor believes you need a Prescription Drug that is not on the Prescription
Drug List, please have your Doctor or pharmacist get in touch with us. We will cover the other Prescription
Drug through a special exception process, but only if we agree that it is Medically Necessary and
appropriate over the other Drugs that are on the List.  We will make a coverage decision within 72 hours
of receiving your request, unless a shorter timeframe is required by applicable law. If we approve the
coverage of the Drug, coverage of the Drug will be provided for the duration of your prescription, including
refills. If we deny coverage of the Drug, you have the right to appeal, including the right to request
independent external review, as explained in the &ldquo;Appeals and Complaints&rdquo; section of this Booklet.
</p>
<p>You, your designee or your Doctor may also submit a request for a Prescription Drug that is not on the
Prescription Drug List based on exigent circumstances.  Exigent circumstances exist if you are suffering
from a health condition that may seriously jeopardize your life, health, or ability to regain maximum
function, or if you are undergoing a current course of treatment using a drug not covered by the Plan. We
will make a coverage decision within 24 hours of receiving your request. If we approve the coverage of
the Drug, coverage of the Drug will be provided for the duration of the exigency. If we deny coverage of
the Drug, you have the right to appeal, including the right to request independent external review, as
explained in the &ldquo;Appeals and Complaints&rdquo; section of this Booklet.
</p>
<p>Coverage of a Drug approved as a result of your request or your Doctor&rsquo;s request for an exception will
only be provided if you are a Member enrolled under the Plan. For additional information about the
exception processes for Drugs not included on your Plan&rsquo;s Prescription Drug List, please call the Member
Services telephone number on the back of your Identification Card.
</p>
<p>Additional Features of Your Prescription Drug Pharmacy Benefit
</p>
<p>Day Supply and Refill Limits
</p>
<p>Certain day supply limits apply to Prescription Drugs as listed in the &ldquo;Schedule of Benefits (Who Pays
What).&rdquo; In most cases, you must use a certain amount of your prescription before it can be refilled. In
some cases we may let you get an early refill. For example, we may let you refill your prescription early if
it is decided that you need a larger dose. We will work with the Pharmacy to decide when this should
happen.
</p>
<p>If you are going on vacation and you need more than the day supply allowed, you should ask your
pharmacist to call our PBM and ask for an override for one early refill. If you need more than one early
refill, please call Member Services at the number on the back of your Identification Card.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>83
</p>
<p>Half-Tablet Program
</p>
<p>The Half-Tablet Program lets you pay a reduced Copayment on selected &ldquo;once daily dosage&rdquo; Drugs on
our approved list.  The program lets you get a 30-day supply (15 tablets) of the higher strength Drug
when the Doctor tells you to take a &ldquo;&frac12; tablet daily.&rdquo; The Half-Tablet Program is strictly voluntary and you
should talk to your Doctor about the choice when it is available.  To get a list of the Drugs in the program
call the number on the back of your Identification Card.
</p>
<p>Therapeutic Substitution
</p>
<p>Therapeutic substitution is an optional program that tells you and your Doctors about alternatives to
certain prescribed Drugs. We may contact you and your Doctor to make you aware of these choices.
Only you and your Doctor can determine if the therapeutic substitute is right for you. For questions or
issues about therapeutic Drug substitutes, call Member Services at the phone number on the back of your
Identification Card.
</p>
<p>Split Fill Dispensing Program
</p>
<p>The split fill dispensing program is designed to prevent and/or minimize wasted Prescription Drugs if your
Prescription Drugs or dose changes between fills, by allowing only a portion of your prescription to be
filled at the Specialty Pharmacy. This program also saves you out of pocket expenses. The Prescription
Drugs that are included under this program have been identified as requiring more frequent follow up to
monitor response to treatment and potential reactions or side-effects. You can access the list of these
Prescription Drugs by calling the toll-free number on your member ID card or log on to the website at
www.anthem.com.
</p>
<p>Special Programs
</p>
<p>Except when prohibited by federal regulations (such as HSA rules), from time to time we may offer
programs to support the use of more cost-effective or clinically effective Prescription Drugs including
Generic Drugs, Home Delivery Drugs, over the counter Drugs or preferred products. Such programs may
reduce or waive Copayments or Coinsurance for a limited time.</p>

<p>Section 9. Member Payment Responsibility
</p>
<p>Your Cost-Shares
</p>
<p>Your Plan may involve Copayments, Deductibles, and/or Coinsurance, which are charges that you must
pay when receiving Covered Services. Your Plan may also have an Out-of-Pocket Limit, which limits the
cost-shares you must pay. Please read the &ldquo;Schedule of Benefits (Who Pays What)&rdquo; for details on your
cost-shares. Also read the &ldquo;Definitions&rdquo; section for a better understanding of each type of cost share.
</p>
<p>Maximum Allowed Amount
</p>
<p>General
</p>
<p>This section describes how we determine the amount of reimbursement for Covered Services.
Reimbursement for services rendered by In-Network Providers is based on this Booklet&rsquo;s Maximum
Allowed Amount for the Covered Service that you receive. Please see &ldquo;Inter-Plan Arrangement&rsquo;s&rdquo; in the
&ldquo;Claims Procedure (How to File a Claim)&rdquo; section for additional information.
</p>
<p>The Maximum Allowed Amount for this Booklet is the maximum amount of reimbursement we will allow
for services and supplies:
</p>
<p>&middot; That meet our definition of Covered Services, to the extent such services and supplies are covered
under your Booklet and are not excluded;
</p>
<p>&middot; That are Medically Necessary; and
&middot; That are provided in accordance with all applicable preauthorization, utilization management or other
</p>
<p>requirements set forth in your Booklet.
</p>
<p>You will be required to pay a portion of the Maximum Allowed Amount to the extent you have not met
your Deductible or have a Copayment or Coinsurance.
</p>
<p>Generally, services received from an Out-of-Network Provider under this product are not covered except
for Emergency Care, or when allowed as a result of a Referral by us.
</p>
<p>When you receive Covered Services from a Provider, we will, to the extent applicable, apply claim
processing rules to the claim submitted for those Covered Services. These rules evaluate the claim
information and, among other things, determine the accuracy and appropriateness of the procedure and
diagnosis codes included in the claim. Applying these rules may affect our determination of the Maximum
Allowed Amount. Our application of these rules does not mean that the Covered Services you received
were not Medically Necessary. It means we have determined that the claim was submitted inconsistent
with procedure coding rules and/or reimbursement policies. For example, your Provider may have
submitted the claim using several procedure codes when there is a single procedure code that includes
all of the procedures that were performed. When this occurs, the Maximum Allowed Amount will be
based on the single procedure code rather than a separate Maximum Allowed Amount for each billed
code.
</p>
<p>Likewise, when multiple procedures are performed on the same day by the same Doctor or other
healthcare professional, we may reduce the Maximum Allowed Amounts for those secondary and
subsequent procedures because reimbursement at 100% of the Maximum Allowed Amount for those
procedures would represent duplicative payment for components of the primary procedure that may be
considered incidental or inclusive.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>93
</p>
<p>For Prescription Drugs, the Maximum Allowed Amount is the amount determined by us using Prescription
Drug cost information provided by the Pharmacy Benefits Manager.
</p>
<p>Member Cost Share
</p>
<p>For certain Covered Services and depending on your Plan design, you may be required to pay a part of
the Maximum Allowed Amount as your cost share amount (for example, Deductible, Copayment, and/or
Coinsurance).
</p>
<p>We will not provide any reimbursement for non-Covered Services.  You may be responsible for the total
amount billed by your Provider for non-Covered Services, regardless of whether such services are
performed by an In-Network or Out-of-Network Provider.  Non-covered services include services
specifically excluded from coverage by the terms of your Plan and received after benefits have been
exhausted Benefits may be exhausted by exceeding, for example, benefit caps or day/visit limits.
</p>
<p>If you receive Covered Services in an In-Network Provider facility from an Out-of-Network Provider, such
as a radiologist, anesthesiologist or pathologist who is employed by or contracted with the In-Network
Hospital or facility, you will pay the In-Network cost share amounts for those Covered Services. You will
not have to pay more for the Covered Services than you would have had to pay if it had been received
from an In-Network Provider.
</p>
<p>Authorized Services
</p>
<p>In some circumstances, such as where there is no In-Network Provider available, or if we don&rsquo;t have an
In-Network Provider within a reasonable number of miles from your home, for the Covered Service, we
may authorize the In-Network cost share amounts (Deductible, Copayment, and/or Coinsurance) to apply
to a claim for a Covered Service you receive from an Out-of-Network Provider. In such circumstances,
you must contact us in advance of obtaining the Covered Service. If approved, we will pay the Out-of-
Network Provider at the In-Network level of benefits and you won&rsquo;t need to pay more for the services than
if the services had been received from an In-Network Provider. A Precertification or preauthorization is not
the same thing as an Authorized Service; we must specifically authorize the service from an Out-of-
Network Provider at the In-Network cost share amounts.
</p>
<p>Sometimes you may need to travel a reasonable distance to get care from an In-Network Provider. This
does not apply if care is for an Emergency.
</p>
<p>The following are examples for illustrative purposes only; the amounts shown may be different
than this Booklet&rsquo;s cost share amounts; see your &ldquo;Schedule of Benefits (Who Pays What)&rdquo; for
your applicable amounts.
</p>
<p>Example:
You require the services of a specialty Provider; but there is no In-Network Provider for that specialty in
your state of residence. You contact us in advance of receiving any Covered Services, and we authorize
you to go to an available Out-of-Network Provider for that Covered Service and we agree that the In-
Network cost share will apply.
</p>
<p>Your Plan has a $25 Copayment for In-Network Providers for the Covered Service. The Out-of-Network
Provider&rsquo;s charge for this service is $500. The Maximum Allowed Amount is $200.
</p>
<p>Because we have authorized the In-Network cost share amount to apply in this situation, you will be
responsible for the In-Network Copayment of $25 and we will be responsible for the remaining $475.</p>
<p/>

</p>
<p>Claims Review
</p>
<p>HMO Colorado has processes to review claims before and after payment to detect fraud, waste, abuse
and other inappropriate activity. Members seeking emergency services, or other services authorized by
us according to the terms of this Plan from Out-of-Network Providers could be balanced billed by the Out-
of-Network Provider for those services that are determined to be not payable as a result of these review
processes. A claim may also be determined to be not payable due to a Provider's failure to submit
medical records with the claims that are under review in these processes.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>95
</p>
<p>Section 10. Claims Procedure (How to File a Claim)
This section describes how we reimburse claims and what information is needed when you submit a
claim. When you receive care from an In-Network Provider, you do not need to file a claim because the
In-Network Provider will do this for you. Please remember that this Plan will not provide benefits for
services from Out-of-Network Providers unless the claim is for Emergency Care or for services
approved in advance by HMO Colorado as an Authorized Service.
</p>
<p>Notice of Claim &amp; Proof of Loss
</p>
<p>After you get Covered Services, we must receive written notice of your claim within 180 days in order for
benefits to be paid. The claim must have the information we need to determine benefits. If the claim
does not include enough information, we will ask for more details and it must be sent to us within the time
listed below or no benefits will be covered, unless required by law.
</p>
<p>In certain cases, you may have some extra time to file a claim. If we did not get your claim within 180
days, but it is sent in as soon as reasonably possible and within one year after the 180-day period ends
(i.e., within 18 months), you may still be able to get benefits. However, any claims, or additional
information on claims, sent in more than 24 months after you get Covered Services will be denied.
</p>
<p>Claims will be processed in the time frame required by any State or federal law for the prompt payment of
claims which applies to this Booklet. Claims which do not require any additional information will usually be
processed within 45 days of when we get the claim (30 days if sent electronically). If we need more
information to decide how or if benefits are to be paid, we will ask for that information within 30 days of
getting the claim. We will provide at least 45 days to give us that information; we will then make a
decision within 15 days of getting the additional information. If the information we ask for is not completely
and timely provided, the claim may be denied.
</p>
<p>Claim Forms
</p>
<p>Claim forms will usually be available from most Providers. If forms are not available, either send a written
request for a claims form to us, or contact Member Services and ask for a claims form to be sent to you.
If you do not receive the claims form within 15 days of notifying us, written notice of services rendered
may be submitted to us without the claim form. The same information that would be given on the claim
form must be included in the written notice of claim. This includes:
</p>
<p>&middot; Name of patient.
&middot; Patient&rsquo;s relationship with the Subscriber.
&middot; Identification number.
&middot; Date, type, and place of service.
&middot; Your signature and the Provider&rsquo;s signature.
</p>
<p>Member&rsquo;s Cooperation
</p>
<p>You will be expected to complete and submit to us all such authorizations, consents, releases,
assignments and other documents that may be needed in order to obtain or assure reimbursement under
Medicare, Workers&rsquo; Compensation or any other governmental program. If you fail to cooperate (including
if you fail to enroll under Part B of the Medicare program where Medicare is the responsible payor), you
will be responsible for any charge for services.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>96
</p>
<p>Payment of Benefits
</p>
<p>We will make benefit payments directly to Network Providers for Covered Services. If you use an Out-of-
Network Provider, however, we may make benefit payments to you unless if you have authorized an
assignment of benefits. An assignment of benefits means you want Us to pay the Provider instead of
you. We may require a copy of the assignment of benefits for Our records. These payments fulfill our
obligation to you for those services. Payments may also be made to, and notice regarding the receipt
and/or adjudication of claims sent to, an Alternate Recipient (any child of a Subscriber who is recognized,
under a Qualified Medical Child Support Order (QMSCO), as having a right to enrollment under the
Group&rsquo;s Contract), or that person&rsquo;s custodial parent or designated representative. Any benefit payments
made by us will discharge our obligation for Covered Services. You cannot assign your right to benefits
to anyone else, except as required by a &ldquo;Qualified Medical Child Support Order&rdquo; as defined by ERISA or
any applicable state law.
</p>
<p>Once a Provider performs a Covered Service, we will not honor a request for us to withhold payment of
the claims submitted.
</p>
<p>Inter-Plan Arrangements
</p>
<p>Out-of-Area Services
Overview
</p>
<p>We have a variety of relationships with other Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Licensees. Generally, these
relationships are called &ldquo;Inter-Plan Arrangements.&rdquo; These Inter-Plan Arrangements work based on rules
and procedures issued by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association (&ldquo;Association&rdquo;). Whenever you access
healthcare services outside the geographic area we serve (the &ldquo;HMO Colorado Service Area&rdquo;), the claim
for those services may be processed through one of these Inter-Plan Arrangements. The Inter-Plan
Arrangements are described below.
</p>
<p>When you receive care outside of the HMO Colorado Service Area, you will receive it from one of two
kinds of Providers. Most Providers (&ldquo;participating providers&rdquo;) contract with the local Blue Cross and/or
Blue Shield Plan in that geographic area (&ldquo;Host Blue&rdquo;). Some Providers (&ldquo;nonparticipating providers&rdquo;)
don&rsquo;t contract with the Host Blue. We explain below how we pay both kinds of Providers.
</p>
<p>HMO Colorado covers only limited healthcare services received outside of the HMO Colorado Service
Area. For example, Emergency or Urgent Care obtained outside the HMO Colorado Service Area is
always covered. Any other services will not be covered when processed through any Inter-Plan
Arrangements, unless authorized by HMO Colorado.
</p>
<p>Inter-Plan Arrangements Eligibility &ndash; Claim Types
</p>
<p>Most claim types are eligible to be processed through Inter-Plan Arrangements, as described above.
Examples of claims that are not included are Prescription Drugs that you obtain from a Pharmacy and
most dental or vision benefits.
</p>
<p>A. BlueCard&reg; Program
</p>
<p>Under the BlueCard&reg; Program, when you receive Covered Services within the geographic area served by
a Host Blue, we will still fulfill our contractual obligations. But, the Host Blue is responsible for: (a)
contracting with its Providers; and (b) handling its interactions with those Providers.
</p>
<p>When you receive Covered Services outside the HMO Colorado Service Area and the claim is processed
through the BlueCard Program, the amount you pay is calculated based on the lower of:</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>97
</p>
<p>&middot; The billed charges for Covered Services; or
</p>
<p>&middot; The negotiated price that the Host Blue makes available to Us.
</p>
<p>Often, this &ldquo;negotiated price&rdquo; will be a simple discount that reflects an actual price that the Host Blue pays
to the Provider. Sometimes, it is an estimated price that takes into account special arrangements with that
Provider. Sometimes, such an arrangement may be an average price, based on a discount that results in
expected average savings for services provided by similar types of Providers. Estimated and average
pricing arrangements may also involve types of settlements, incentive payments and/or other credits or
charges.
</p>
<p>Estimated pricing and average pricing also take into account adjustments to correct for over- or
underestimation of past pricing of claims, as noted above. However, such adjustments will not affect the
price we used for your claim because they will not be applied after a claim has already been paid.
</p>
<p>B. Special Cases: Value-Based Programs
</p>
<p>BlueCard&reg; Program
</p>
<p>If you receive Covered Services under a Value-Based Program inside a Host Blue&rsquo;s Service Area, you will
not be responsible for paying any of the Provider Incentives, risk-sharing, and/or Care Coordinator Fees
that are a part of such an arrangement, except when a Host Blue passes these fees to HMO Colorado
through average pricing or fee schedule adjustments. Additional information is available upon request.
</p>
<p>C. Inter-Plan Programs: Federal/State Taxes/Surcharges/Fees
</p>
<p>Federal or state laws or regulations may require a surcharge, tax or other fee. If applicable, we will
include any such surcharge, tax or other fee as part of the claim charge passed on to you.
</p>
<p>D. Nonparticipating Providers Outside Our Service Area
</p>
<p>1. Allowed Amounts and Member Liability Calculation
</p>
<p>When Covered Services are provided outside of HMO Colorado&rsquo;s Service Area by non-participating
providers, we may determine benefits and make payment based on pricing from either the Host
Blue or the pricing arrangements required by applicable state or federal law. In these situations,
the amount you pay for such services as Deductible, Copayment or Coinsurance will be based on
that allowed amount. Also, you may be responsible for the difference between the amount that the
non-participating provider bills and the payment we will make for the Covered Services as set forth
in this paragraph. Federal or state law, as applicable, will govern payments for out-of-network
Emergency services.
</p>
<p>2. Exceptions
</p>
<p>In certain situations, we may use other pricing methods, such as billed charges or the pricing we
would use if the healthcare services had been obtained within the HMO Colorado Service Area, or
a special negotiated price to determine the amount we will pay for services provided by
nonparticipating providers. In these situations, you may be liable for the difference between the
amount that the nonparticipating provider bills and the payment we make for the Covered Services
as set forth in this paragraph.
</p>
<p>E. BlueCard Worldwide&reg; Program
</p>
<p>If you plan to travel outside the United States, call Member Services to find out your BlueCard Worldwide
benefits. Benefits for services received outside of the United States may be different from services</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>98
</p>
<p>received in the United States. The Plan only covers Emergency, including ambulance, and Urgent Care
outside of the United States. Remember to take an up to date health ID card with you.
</p>
<p>When you are traveling abroad and need medical care, you can call the BlueCard Worldwide Service
Center any time. They are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The toll free number is 800-
810-2583. Or you can call them collect at 804-673-1177.
</p>
<p>Keep in mind, if you need Emergency medical care, go to the nearest hospital. There is no need to call
before you receive care.
</p>
<p>Please refer to the &ldquo;How to Access Your Services and Obtain Approval of Benefits&rdquo; section in this Booklet
for further information.
</p>
<p>How Claims are Paid with BlueCard Worldwide
</p>
<p>In most cases, when you arrange inpatient hospital care with BlueCard Worldwide, claims will be filed for
you. The only amounts that you may need to pay up front are any Copayment, Coinsurance or
Deductible amounts that may apply.
</p>
<p>You will typically need to pay for the following services up front:
</p>
<p>&middot; Doctors services;
</p>
<p>&middot; Inpatient hospital care not arranged through BlueCard Worldwide; and
</p>
<p>&middot; Outpatient services.
</p>
<p>You will need to file a claim form for any payments made up front.
</p>
<p>When you need BlueCard Worldwide claim forms you can get international claims forms in the following
ways:
</p>
<p>&middot; Call the BlueCard Worldwide Service Center at the numbers above; or
</p>
<p>&middot; Online at www.bluecardworldwide.com.
</p>
<p>You will find the address for mailing the claim on the form.</p>

<p>Section 11. General Policy Provisions
</p>
<p>Assignment
</p>
<p>The Group cannot legally transfer this Booklet, without obtaining written permission from us. Members
cannot legally transfer the coverage. Benefits available under this Booklet are not assignable by any
Member without obtaining written permission from us, unless in a way described in the &ldquo;How to Access
Your Services and Obtain Approval of Benefits (Applicable to Managed Care Plans)&rdquo; and in &ldquo;Claims
Procedure (How to File a Claim)&rdquo; sections.
</p>
<p>Automobile Insurance Provisions
</p>
<p>We will coordinate the benefits of this Booklet with the benefits of a complying auto insurance policy.
</p>
<p>A complying automobile insurance policy is an auto policy approved by the Colorado Division of
Insurance that provides at least the minimum coverage required by law, and one which is subject to the
Colorado Auto Accident Reparations Act or Colorado Revised Statutes &sect;&sect; 10-4-601 et seq. Any state or
federal law requiring similar benefits through legislation or regulation is also considered a complying auto
policy.
</p>
<p>How We Coordinate Benefits with Auto Policies - Your benefits under this Booklet may be coordinated
with the coverage&rsquo;s afforded by an auto policy. After any primary coverage&rsquo;s offered by the auto policy
are exhausted, including without limitation any no-fault, personal injury protection, or medical payment
coverages, We will pay benefits subject to the terms and conditions of this Booklet. If there is more than
one auto policy that offers primary coverage, each will pay its maximum coverage before We are liable for
any further payments.
</p>
<p>You, your representative, agents and heirs must fully cooperate with Us to make sure that the auto policy
has paid all required benefits. We may require you to take a physical examination in disputed cases. If
there is an auto policy in effect, and you waive or fail to assert your rights to such benefits, this plan will
not pay those benefits that could be available under an auto policy.
</p>
<p>We may require proof that the auto policy has paid all primary benefits before making any payments
under this Booklet. On the other hand, we may but are not required to pay benefits under this Booklet,
and later coordinate with or seek reimbursement under the auto policy. In all cases, upon payment, we
are entitled to exercise Our rights under this Booklet and under applicable law against any and all
potentially responsible parties or insurers. In that event, we may exercise the rights found in this section.
</p>
<p>What Happens If You Do Not Have Another Policy - We will pay benefits if you are injured while you
are riding in or driving a motor vehicle that you own if it is not covered by an auto policy.
</p>
<p>Similarly if not covered by an auto policy, we will also pay benefits for your injuries if as a non-owner or
driver, passenger or when walking you were in a motor vehicle accident. In that event, we may exercise
the rights found in this section.
</p>
<p>Care Coordination
</p>
<p>We pay In-Network Providers in various ways to provide Covered Services to you. For example,
sometimes we may pay In-Network Providers a separate amount for each Covered Service they provide.
We may also pay them one amount for all Covered Services related to treatment of a medical condition.
Other times, we may pay a periodic, fixed pre-determined amount to cover the costs of Covered Services.
In addition, we may pay In-Network Providers financial incentives or other amounts to help improve
quality of care and/or promote the delivery of health care services in a cost-efficient manner, or
compensate In-Network Providers for coordination of Member care. In some instances, In-Network</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>100
</p>
<p>Providers may be required to make payment to us because they did not meet certain standards. You do
not share in any payments made by In-Network Providers to us under these programs.
</p>
<p>Clerical Error
</p>
<p>A clerical error will never disturb or affect your coverage, as long as your coverage is valid under the rules
of the Plan. This rule applies to any clerical error, regardless of whether it was the fault of the Group or
us.
</p>
<p>Confidentiality and Release of Information
</p>
<p>We will use reasonable efforts, and take the same care to preserve the confidentiality of your medical
information. We may use data collected in the course of providing services hereunder for statistical
evaluation and research. If such data is ever released to a third party, it shall be released only in
aggregate statistical form without identifying you. Medical information may be released only with your
written consent or as required by law. It must be signed, dated and must specify the nature of the
information and to which persons and organizations it may be disclosed. You may access your own
medical records.
</p>
<p>We may release your medical information to professional peer review organizations and to the Group for
purposes of reporting claims experience or conducting an audit of our operations, provided the
information disclosed is reasonably necessary for the Group to conduct the review or audit.
</p>
<p>A statement describing our policies and procedures for preserving the confidentiality of medical records is
available and will be furnished to you upon request.
</p>
<p>Conformity with Law
</p>
<p>Any term of the Plan which is in conflict with the laws of the state in which the Group Contract is issued,
or with federal law, will hereby be automatically amended to conform with the minimum requirements of
such laws.

Colorado. The Blue Cross Blue Shield marks are registered by the Blue Cross and Blue Shield
Association, an association of independently licensed Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, with the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office in Washington, D.C. and in other countries. Further, we are not contracting
as the agent of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association or any other Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield
plan or licensee. The Group, on behalf of itself and its participants, further acknowledges and agrees that
it has not entered into this Contract based upon representations by any person other than HMO Colorado
and that no person, entity, or organization other than HMO Colorado shall be held accountable or liable to
the Group for any of HMO Colorado&lsquo;s obligations to the Group created under the Contract. This
paragraph shall not create any additional obligations whatsoever on our part other than those obligations
created under other terms of this agreement.

</p>
<p>This Booklet, any riders, endorsements or attachments, and the individual applications of the Subscriber
and Dependents constitute the entire Contract between the Group and us and as of the Effective Date,
supersede all other agreements. In addition the Group has a Group Contract and Group Application
which includes terms that apply to this coverage. Any and all statements made to us by the Group and
any and all statements made to the Group by us are representations and not warranties. No such
statement, unless it is contained in a written application for coverage under this Booklet, shall be used in
defense to a claim under this Booklet.
</p>
<p>Form or Content of Booklet
</p>
<p>No agent or employee of ours is authorized to change the form or content of this Booklet. Changes can
only be made through a written authorization, signed by an officer of HMO Colorado. Changes are further
noted in &ldquo;Modifications&rdquo; below this section.
</p>
<p>Government Programs
</p>
<p>The benefits under this Plan shall not duplicate any benefits that you are entitled to, or eligible for, under
any other governmental program. This does not apply if any particular laws require us to be the primary
payor. If we have duplicated such benefits, all money paid by such programs to you for services you
have or are receiving, shall be returned by or on your behalf to us.
</p>
<p>Medical Policy and Technology Assessment
</p>
<p>HMO Colorado reviews and evaluates new technology according to its technology evaluation criteria
developed by its medical directors. Technology assessment criteria are used to determine the
Experimental / Investigational status or Medical Necessity of new technology. Guidance and external
validation of HMO Colorado&rsquo;s medical policy is provided by the Medical Policy and Technology
Assessment Committee (MPTAC) which consists of approximately 20 Doctors from various medical
specialties including HMO Colorado&rsquo;s medical directors, Doctors in academic medicine and Doctors in
private practice.
</p>
<p>Conclusions made are incorporated into medical policy used to establish decision protocols for particular
diseases or treatments and applied to Medical Necessity criteria used to determine whether a procedure,
service, supply or equipment is covered.
</p>
<p>Medicare
</p>
<p>Any benefits covered under both this Plan and Medicare will be covered according to Medicare
Secondary Payor legislation, regulations, and Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services guidelines,
subject to federal court decisions. Federal law controls whenever there is a conflict among state law,
Booklet terms, and federal law.
</p>
<p>Except when federal law requires us to be the primary payor, the benefits under this Plan for Members
age 65 and older, or Members otherwise eligible for Medicare, do not duplicate any benefit for which
Members are entitled under Medicare, including Part B. Where Medicare is the responsible payor, all
sums payable by Medicare for services provided to you shall be reimbursed by or on your behalf to us, to
the extent we have made payment for such services. For the purposes of the calculation of benefits, if
you have not enrolled in Medicare Parts B, we will calculate benefits as if you had enrolled. You should
enroll in Medicare Part B as soon as possible to avoid potential liability.</p>

<p>Modifications
</p>
<p>This Booklet allows the Group to make Plan coverage available to eligible Members. However, this
Booklet shall be subject to amendment, modification, and termination in accordance with any of its terms,
the Group Contract, or by mutual agreement between the Group and us without the permission or
involvement of any Member. Changes will not be effective until the date specified in the written notice we
give to the Group about the change. By electing medical and Hospital coverage under the Plan or
accepting Plan benefits, all Members who are legally capable of entering into a contract, and the legal
representatives of all Members that are incapable of entering into a contract, agree to all terms and
conditions in this Booklet.
</p>
<p>For employer groups of one to 100, if we amend this Booklet to change benefits, notice of the amendment
will be given to the employer no less than 90 days before to the Effective Date of such change and the
amendment(s) will be effective for each group on the renewal or anniversary date of the Group Contract.
</p>
<p>For all other changes, such as changes due to state or federal law or regulation, we may amend this
Booklet when authorized by one of our officers and, to the extent required by law, will provide the Group
60 days&rsquo; notice of such changes. We will then provide the Group with any amendments within 60 days
following the effective date of the amendment. If the Group requests a change that reduces or eliminates
coverage, such change must be requested in writing or signed by the Group. The Group will notify you of
such change(s) to coverage. We or the Group will later send or make available to you an amendment to
this Booklet or a new Booklet.
</p>
<p>Network Access Plan
</p>
<p>We strive to provide Provider networks in Colorado that addresses your health care needs. The Network
Access Plan describes our Provider network standards for network sufficiency in service, access and
availability, as well as assessment procedures we follow in our effort to maintain adequate and accessible
networks. To request a copy of this document, call Member Services. This document is also available on
our website or for in-person review at 700 Broadway in Denver, Colorado.
</p>
<p>Not Liable for Provider Acts or Omissions
</p>
<p>We are not responsible for the actual care you receive from any person. This Booklet does not give
anyone any claim, right, or cause of action against HMO Colorado based on the actions of a Provider of
health care, services, or supplies.
</p>
<p>Payment Innovation Programs
</p>
<p>We pay In-Network Providers through various types of contractual arrangements. Some of these
arrangements &ndash; Payment Innovation Programs (Program(s)) &ndash; may include financial incentives to help
improve quality of care and promote the delivery of health care services in a cost-efficient manner.
</p>
<p>These Programs may vary in methodology and subject area of focus and may be modified by us from
time to time, but they will be generally designed to tie a certain portion of an In-Network Provider&rsquo;s total
compensation to pre-defined quality, cost, efficiency or service standards or metrics. In some instances,
In-Network Providers may be required to make payment to us under the Program as a consequence of
failing to meet these pre-defined standards.
</p>
<p>The Programs are not intended to affect your access to health care. The Program payments are not
made as payment for specific Covered Services provided to you, but instead, are based on the In-
Network Provider&rsquo;s achievement of these pre-defined standards. You are not responsible for any
Copayment or Coinsurance amounts related to payments made by us or to us under the Program(s), and
you do not share in any payments made by Network Providers to us under the Program(s).</p>

</p>
<p>Policies and Procedures
</p>
<p>We are able to introduce new policies, procedures, rules and interpretations, as long as they are
reasonable. Such changes are introduced to make the Plan more orderly and efficient. Members must
follow and accept any new policies, procedures, rules, and interpretations.
</p>
<p>Under the terms of the Group Contract, we have the authority, in our sole discretion, to introduce or
terminate from time to time, pilot or test programs for disease management or wellness initiatives which
may result in the payment of benefits not otherwise specified in this Booklet. We reserve the right to
discontinue a pilot or test program at any time.
</p>
<p>Program Incentives
</p>
<p>We may offer incentives from time to time, at our discretion, in order to introduce you to covered
programs and services available under this Plan. The purpose of these incentives include, but is not
limited to, making you aware of cost effective benefit options or services, helping you achieve your best
health, and encouraging you to update member-related information. These incentives may be offered in
various forms such as retailer coupons, gift cards, health related merchandise, and discounts on fees or
Member cost shares. Acceptance of these incentives is voluntary as long as Anthem offers the incentives
program. We may discontinue an incentive for a particular covered program or service at any time. If
you have any questions about whether receipt of an incentive or retailer coupon results in taxable income
to you, we recommend that you consult your tax advisor.
</p>
<p>Relationship of Parties (Group-Member-HMO Colorado)
</p>
<p>The Group is responsible for passing information to you. For example, if we give notice to the Group, it is
the Group&rsquo;s responsibility to pass that information to you. The Group is also responsible for passing
eligibility data to us in a timely manner. If the Group does not give us with timely enrollment and
termination information, we are not responsible for the payment of Covered Services for Members.
</p>
<p>Relationship of Parties (HMO Colorado and In-Network Providers)
</p>
<p>The relationship between HMO Colorado and In-Network Providers is an independent contractor
relationship. In-Network Providers are not agents or employees of ours, nor is HMO Colorado, or any
employee of HMO Colorado, an employee or agent of In-Network Providers.
</p>
<p>Your health care Provider is solely responsible for all decisions regarding your care and treatment,
regardless of whether such care and treatment is a Covered Service under this Plan. We shall not be
responsible for any claim or demand on account of damages arising out of, or in any manner connected
with, any injuries suffered by you while receiving care from any In-Network Provider or in any In-Network
Provider&rsquo;s Facilities.
</p>
<p>Your In-Network Provider&rsquo;s agreement for providing Covered Services may include financial incentives or
risk sharing relationships related to the provision of services or referrals to other Providers, including In-
Network Providers, Out-of-Network Providers, and disease management programs. If you have
questions regarding such incentives or risk sharing relationships, please contact your Provider or us.
</p>
<p>Reservation of Discretionary Authority
</p>
<p>This section only applies when the interpretation of this Booklet is governed by the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>104
</p>
<p>We, or anyone acting on our behalf, shall determine the administration of benefits and eligibility for
participation in such a manner that has a rational relationship to the terms set forth herein. However, we,
or anyone acting on our behalf, have complete discretion to determine the administration of your benefits.
Our determination shall be final and conclusive and may include, without limitation, determination of
whether the services, care, treatment, or supplies are Medically Necessary, Experimental /
Investigational, whether surgery is cosmetic, and whether charges are consistent with the Maximum
Allowable Amount. However, a Member may utilize all applicable complaint and appeals procedures, and
where required by applicable law, Our determination may be reviewed de novo (as if for the first time) in a
later appeal or legal action.
</p>
<p>We, or anyone acting on our behalf, shall have all the powers necessary or appropriate to enable us to
carry out the duties in connection with the operation and administration of the Plan. This includes, without
limitation, the power to construe the Contract, to determine all questions arising under the Booklet and to
make, establish and amend the rules, regulations, and procedures with regard to the interpretation and
administration of the provisions of this Plan. However, these powers shall be exercised in such a manner
that has reasonable relationship to the provisions of the Contract, the Booklet, Provider agreements, and
applicable state or federal laws. A specific limitation or exclusion will override more general benefit
language.
</p>
<p>Right of Recovery and Adjustment
</p>
<p>Whenever payment has been made in error, we will have the right to recover such payment from you or, if
applicable, the Provider, or otherwise make appropriate adjustment to claims. In most instances such
recovery or adjustment activity shall be limited to the calendar year in which the error is discovered.
</p>
<p>We have oversight responsibility for compliance with Provider and vendor contracts. We may enter into a
settlement or compromise regarding enforcement of these contracts and may retain any recoveries made
from a Provider or vendor resulting from these audits if the return of the overpayment is not feasible.
Additionally, we have established recovery and adjustment policies to determine which recoveries and
adjustments are to be pursued, when to incur costs and expenses and settle or compromise recovery or
adjustment amounts. We will not pursue recoveries for overpayments or adjustments for underpayments
if the cost of the activity exceeds the overpayment or underpayment amount.
</p>
<p>Unauthorized Use of Identification Card
</p>
<p>If you permit your Identification Card to be used by someone else or if you use the card before coverage
is in effect or after coverage has ended, you will be liable for payment of any expenses incurred resulting
from the unauthorized use.  Fraudulent misuse could also result in termination of the coverage.
</p>
<p>Value-Added Programs
</p>
<p>We may offer health or fitness related programs to our Members, through which you may access
discounted rates from certain vendors for products and services available to the general public. Products
and services available under this program are not Covered Services under your Plan but are in addition to
Plan benefits. As such, program features are not guaranteed under your health Plan Contract and could
be discontinued at any time. We do not endorse any vendor, product or service associated with this
program. Program vendors are solely responsible for the products and services you receive.
</p>
<p>Value of Covered Services
</p>
<p>For purposes of subrogation, reimbursement of excess benefits, or reimbursement under any Workers&rsquo;
Compensation or Employer Liability Law, the value of Covered Services shall be the amount we paid for
the Covered Services.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>105
</p>
<p>Voluntary Clinical Quality Programs
</p>
<p>We may offer additional opportunities to assist you in obtaining certain covered preventive or other care
(e.g., well child check-ups or certain laboratory screening tests) that you have not received in the
recommended timeframe. These opportunities are called voluntary clinical quality programs. They are
designed to encourage you to get certain care when you need it and are separate from Covered Services
under your Plan. These programs are not guaranteed and could be discontinued at any time. We will
give you the choice and if you choose to participate in one of these programs, and obtain the
recommended care within the program&rsquo;s timeframe, you may receive incentives such as gift cards or
retailer coupons, which we encourage you to use for health and wellness related activities or items.
Under other clinical quality programs, you may receive a home test kit that allows you to collect the
specimen for certain covered laboratory tests at home and mail it to the laboratory for processing. You
may also be offered a home visit appointment to collect such specimens and complete biometric
screenings. You may need to pay any cost shares that normally apply to such covered laboratory tests
(e.g., those applicable to the laboratory processing fee) but will not need to pay for the home test kit or
the home visit. If you have any questions about whether receipt of a gift card or retailer coupon results in
taxable income to you, we recommend that you consult your tax advisor.
</p>
<p>Voluntary Wellness Incentive Programs
</p>
<p>We may offer health or fitness related program options for selection by your Group to help you achieve
your best health. These programs are not Covered Services under your Plan, but are separate
components, which are not guaranteed under this Plan and could be discontinued at any time. If your
Group has selected one of these options to make available to all employees, you may receive incentives
such as gift cards by participating in or completing such voluntary wellness promotion programs as health
assessments, weight management or tobacco cessation coaching. Under other options a Group may
select, you may receive such incentives by achieving specified standards based on health factors under
wellness programs that comply with applicable law. If you think you might be unable to meet the
standard, you might qualify for an opportunity to earn the same reward by different means. You may
contact us at the Member Services number on your ID card and we will work with you (and, if you wish,
your Doctor) to find a wellness program with the same reward that is right for you in light of your health
status. (If you receive a gift card as a wellness reward and use it for purposes other than for qualified
medical expenses, this may result in taxable income to you. For additional guidance, please consult your
tax advisor.)
</p>
<p>Waiver
</p>
<p>No agent or other person, except an authorized officer of HMO Colorado, is able to disregard any
conditions or restrictions contained in this Booklet, to extend the amount of time for making a payment to
us, or to bind us by making any promise or representation or by giving or receiving any information.
</p>
<p>Workers&rsquo; Compensation
</p>
<p>The benefits under this Plan are not designed to duplicate benefits that you are eligible for under
Workers&rsquo; Compensation Law. All money paid or owed by Workers&rsquo; Compensation for services provided
to you shall be paid back by you, or on your behalf, to us if we have made or make payment for the
services received. It is understood that coverage under this Plan does not replace or affect any Workers&rsquo;
Compensation coverage requirements.
</p>
<p>Subrogation and Reimbursement
</p>
<p>This section applies when we pay benefits as a result of injuries or illness and another party or party(ies)
agrees or is ordered to pay money because of these injuries or when the Member received or is entitled</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>106
</p>
<p>to receive a recovery because of these injuries or illnesses. Recovery is money the Member, the
Member&rsquo;s legal representative, or beneficiary receives whether by settlement, verdict, judgment, order or
by some other monetary award or determination, from another, their insurer, or from any uninsured
motorist, underinsured motorist, medical payments, personal injury protection, or any other insurance
coverage, to compensate the Member as a result of bodily injury or illness to the Member. Regardless of
how the Member, the Member&rsquo;s legal representative, or beneficiary or any agreement may characterize
the money received, it shall be subject to this Subrogation and Reimbursement section of this Booklet.
</p>
<p>Reimbursement or subrogation under this Booklet may only be permitted if you have been fully
compensated, and, the amount recoverable by us may be reduced by a proportionate share of your
attorney fees and costs, if state law so requires.
</p>
<p>Subrogation
</p>
<p>We have the right to recover payments we make on your behalf. The following apply:
</p>
<p>&middot; If you have been fully compensated, we have a lien against all or a portion of the benefits that have
been paid to you from the following parties, including, but not limited to, the party or parties who
caused the injuries or illness, the insurer or other indemnifier of the party or parties who caused the
injuries or illness, a guarantor of the party or parties who caused the injuries or illness, your own
insurer (for example, uninsured, underinsured, medical payments or no-fault coverage, or a worker&rsquo;s
compensation insurer), or any other person, entity, policy or plan that may be liable or legally
responsible in relation to the injuries or illness. However, our recovery cannot exceed the amount
actually paid by us under this Booklet as it relates to the injuries or illness that are the subject of the
subrogation action; and
</p>
<p>&middot; You and your legal representative must do whatever is necessary to enable us to exercise our rights
and do nothing to prejudice them. If you have not pursued a claim against a third party allegedly at
fault for your injuries by the date that is sixty (60) days before to the date on which the applicable
statute of limitations expires, we have a right to bring legal action against the at-fault party.
</p>
<p>Reimbursement
</p>
<p>If you, a person who represents your legal interest, or beneficiary have been fully compensated and We
have not been repaid for the health insurance benefits we paid on the Member&rsquo;s behalf, we shall have a
right to be repaid from the recovery in the amount of the health insurance benefits we paid on your behalf
and the following apply:
</p>
<p>&middot; You must promptly reimburse us to the extent of the health insurance benefits we paid on the
Member&rsquo;s behalf from any recovery, including, but not limited to, the party or parties who caused the
injuries or illness, the insurer or other indemnifier of the party or parties who caused the injuries or
illness, a guarantor of the party or parties who caused the injuries or illness, your own insurer (for
example, underinsured, medical payments, or a worker&rsquo;s compensation insurer), or any other person,
entity, policy or plan that may be liable or legally responsible in relation to the injuries or illness;
</p>
<p>&middot; Notwithstanding any allocation made in a settlement agreement or court order, we shall have a right
of reimbursement; and
</p>
<p>&middot; You, a person who represents your legal interest, or beneficiary must hold in trust for us right away
the amount recovered in gross that is to be paid to us, and that amount must not be dissipated or
spent until we have been repaid in accordance with these provisions. The amount recovered in gross
is the total amount of your recovery reduced by your lawyer fees and costs.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>107
</p>
<p>The Member&rsquo;s Duties
</p>
<p>&middot; You, a person who represents your legal interest, or beneficiary must tell us right away the how, when
and where an accident or event that resulted in your injury or illness. We must find out what
happened and get all the details about the parties involved;
</p>
<p>&middot; You, a person who represents your legal interest, or beneficiary must work with us in investigating,
settling and protecting rights;
</p>
<p>&middot; You, a person who represents your legal interest, or beneficiary must send us copies of all police
reports, notices or other papers received in connection with the accident or incident resulting in
personal injury or illness;
</p>
<p>&middot; You, a person who represents your legal interest, or beneficiary must promptly notify us if you retain
an attorney or if a lawsuit is filed;
</p>
<p>&middot; You, a person who represents your legal interest, or beneficiary must immediately notify us if a trial
begins or a settlement occurs;
</p>
<p>&middot; If you, a person who represents your legal interest, or beneficiary gets a recovery that is less than the
sum of all your damages incurred by you, you are required to tell us within 60 days of your receipt of
the recovery. The notice to us must include:
</p>
<p>- Total amount and source of the recovery;
</p>
<p>- Coverage limits applicable to any available insurance policy, contract or benefit plan; and
</p>
<p>- The amount of any costs charged to you.
</p>
<p>&middot; If we receive your notice that you have not been fully paid, we have the right to dispute that
determination;
</p>
<p>&middot; If we dispute whether your recovery is less than the sum of all your damages, such dispute must be
resolved through arbitration; and
</p>
<p>&middot; If you, a person who represents your legal interest, or beneficiary resides in a state where automobile
personal injury protection or medical payment coverage is mandatory, that coverage is primary and
the Booklet takes secondary status. The Booklet will reduce benefits for an amount equal to, but not
less than, that state&rsquo;s mandatory minimum personal injury protection or medical payment
requirement.
</p>
<p>Coordination of Benefits When Members Are Insured Under More
Than One Plan
</p>
<p>We may coordinate benefits when you have coverage with more than one health coverage.
</p>
<p>Duplicate Coverage
</p>
<p>Duplicate coverage is the term used to describe when you are covered by this Booklet and also covered
by another:
</p>
<p>&middot; Group or group-type health insurance;
</p>
<p>&middot; Health or dental benefits coverage; or
</p>
<p>&middot; Blanket coverage.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>108
</p>
<p>The Rules for Coordination of Benefits below determine the order in which each plan will pay a claim for
benefits. The plan that pays first is the primary plan. The primary plan must pay benefits according to its
policy terms regardless of the possibility that another plan may cover some expenses. The plan that pays
after the primary plan is the secondary plan. The secondary plan may reduce the benefits it pays so that
payments from all plans do not exceed 100% of the total allowable expense.
</p>
<p>As used in the section, allowable expense is a health care expense, including Deductibles, Coinsurance
and Copayments, that is covered at least in part by any plan covering you. When a plan provides benefits
in the form of services, the reasonable cash value of each service will be considered an allowable
expense and a benefit paid. An expense that is not covered by any plan covering you is not an allowable
expense. In addition, any expense that a Provider by law or in accordance with a contractual agreement
is prohibited from charging you is not an allowable expense.
</p>
<p>The following are not allowable expense:
</p>
<p>1. The difference between the cost of a semi-private hospital room and a private hospital room, unless
one of the plans provides coverage for private hospital room expenses.
</p>
<p>2. If you are covered by two plans that calculate benefits or services on the basis of a usual and
customary fees or relative value schedule reimbursement method or some other similar
reimbursement method, any amount in excess of the higher of the reasonable and customary
amounts.
</p>
<p>3. If you are covered by two plans that provide benefits or services on the basis of negotiated rates or
fees, an amount in excess of the highest of the negotiated rates.
</p>
<p>4. If you are covered by one plan that calculates its benefits or services on the basis of usual and
customary fees or relative value schedule reimbursement methodology or other similar
reimbursement methodology and another plan that provides its benefits or services on the basis of
negotiated fees, the primary plan&rsquo;s payment arrangement shall be the allowable expense for all plans.
However, if the Provider has contracted with the Secondary plan to provide the benefit or service for a
specific negotiated fee or payment amount that is different than the primary plan&rsquo;s payment
arrangement and if the Provider&rsquo;s contract permits, the negotiated fee or payment shall be the
allowable expense used by the secondary plan to determine its benefits.
</p>
<p>5. The amount of any benefit reduction by the primary plan because you failed to comply with the Plan
provisions is not an allowable expense. Examples of these types of plan provisions include second
surgical opinions, Precertification of admissions, and preferred provider arrangements.
</p>
<p>6. If you advise us that all plans covering you are high deductible health plans as defined by Section 223
of the Internal Revenue Code, and you intend to contribute to a health savings account established in
accordance with Section 223 of the Internal Revenue Code, any amount that is subject to the primary
high deductible health plan&rsquo;s deductible.
</p>
<p>Order of Benefit Determination Rules &ndash; The following rules are used in the order as listed:
</p>
<p>Pediatric Dental Coordination of Benefits (COB)
</p>
<p>These pediatric dental COB provisions, items 1 and 2 below are applicable to only the pediatric dental
benefits found in the &ldquo;Benefits/Coverage (What is Covered)&rdquo; section in the part &ldquo;Dental Services for
Members thorough Age 18&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>1. If pediatric dental Essential Health Benefits are included as part of the medical plan, the medical plan
will be the primary coverage and any standalone dental plan will be secondary.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>109
</p>
<p>2. If the member has two medical plans, each offering pediatric dental Essential Health Benefit coverage
for spouse and family, the Order of Benefits Determination rules below apply.
</p>
<p>How We Determine Which Coverage is Primary and Which is Secondary
</p>
<p>We will determine the primary coverage and secondary coverage according to the following rule: A plan
that does not have order of benefit determination rules or if it has rules will always be primary unless the
provisions of both plans state that the plan is primary.
</p>
<p>Non-Dependent or Dependent
</p>
<p>The plan that covers the person other than as a dependent, for example as an employee, member,
subscriber or retiree, is primary and the plan that covers the person, as a dependent, is secondary. If the
person is a Medicare beneficiary, please refer to the section below of &ldquo;Determining Primacy Between
Medicare and Us&rdquo; for primary and secondary payer rules.
</p>
<p>Active Employee, Retired or Laid-Off Employee
</p>
<p>a. The plan that covers a person as an active employee, who is not laid off or retired, or a dependent of
an active employee, is the primary plan.
</p>
<p>b. If the secondary, or other plan, does not have this rule, and as result the plans do not agree on the
order of benefits, this rule is ignored.
</p>
<p>c. This rule does not apply if the section above of &ldquo;Non-Dependent or Dependent&rdquo; can determine the
order of benefits.
</p>
<p>COBRA or State Continuation Coverage
</p>
<p>a. If a person whose coverage is provided in accordance with COBRA, or under a right of continuation
according to state or federal law is covered under another plan, the plan covering the person as an
employee, member, subscriber or retiree or covering the person as a dependent of an employee,
member, subscriber, or retiree, is the primary plan and the plan covering that same person in
accordance with COBRA, or under a right of continuation in accordance with state or other federal
law, is the secondary plan.
</p>
<p>b. If the other plan does not have this rule, and if, as a result, the plans do not agree on the order of
benefits, this rule is ignored.
</p>
<p>c. This rule does not apply if the section above of &ldquo;Non-Dependent or Dependent&rdquo; can determine the
order of benefits.
</p>
<p>Longer or Shorter Length of Coverage
</p>
<p>a. If the rules above do not determine the order of benefits, the plan that covered the person for the
longer period of time is primary plan and the plan that covered the person for the shorter period of
time is the secondary plan.
</p>
<p>b. To determine the length of time a person has been covered under a plan, two (2) successive
plans will be treated as one if the covered person was eligible under the second within twenty-
four (24) hours after the first ended.
</p>
<p>c. The start of a new plan does not include:
</p>
<p>(1) A change in the amount or scope of a plan&rsquo;s benefits;
</p>
<p>(2) A change in the entity that pays, provides or administers the plan&rsquo;s benefits; or</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>110
</p>
<p>(3) A change from one type of plan to another (such as, from a single employer plan to that of a
multiple employer plan).
</p>
<p>d. The person&rsquo;s length of time covered under a plan is measured from the person&rsquo;s first date of
coverage under that plan. If that date is not readily available for a group plan, the date the person
first became a member of the group will be used as the date from which to determine the length
of time the person&rsquo;s coverage under the present plan has been in force.
</p>
<p>If none of the rules above determine the primary plan, the allowable expense will be shared equally
between the plans.
</p>
<p>Dependent Child Covered Under More Than One Plan
</p>
<p>Unless there is a court decree stating otherwise, plans covering a dependent child will determine the
order of benefits as follows:
</p>
<p>a. For a dependent child whose parents are married or are living together, whether or not they have
been married:
</p>
<p>(1) The plan of the parent whose birthday falls earlier in the calendar year, by month and day, is the
primary plan; or
</p>
<p>(2) If both parents have the same birthday, the plan that has covered the parent the longest is the
primary plan.
</p>
<p>b. For a dependent child whose parents are divorced or separated or are not living together, whether or
not they have ever been married:
</p>
<p>(1) If the court decree states that one of the parents is responsible for the dependent child&rsquo;s health
care expenses or health care coverage, and the plan of that parent has actual knowledge of
those terms, that plan is primary. If the parent with financial responsibility has no health care
coverage for the dependent child&rsquo;s health care, but that parent&rsquo;s spouse does, the spouse&rsquo;s plan
is primary. This item will not apply with respect to a plan year during which benefits are paid or
provided before the entity has actual knowledge of the court decree provision;
</p>
<p>(2) If the court decree states that both parents are responsible for the dependent child&rsquo;s health care
expenses or health care coverage, paragraph a above will determine the order of benefits;
</p>
<p>(3) If the divorce decree states that the parents have joint custody without specifying that one parent
has responsibility for the health care expenses or health care coverage of the depend child,
paragraph a above will determine the order of benefits; or
</p>
<p>(4) If there is no court decree allocating responsibility for the child&rsquo;s health care expenses of health
care coverage, the order of benefits for the child are as follows:
</p>
<p>(a) The plan of the custodial parent;
</p>
<p>(b) The plan of the spouse of the custodial parent;
</p>
<p>(c) The plan of the noncustodial parent; and then
</p>
<p>(d) The plan of the spouse of the noncustodial parent.
</p>
<p>c. For a dependent child covered under more than one plan of individuals who are not parents of the
child, the order of benefits will be determined, as applicable, according to paragraph a. or b. above as
if those individuals were the parents of the child.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>111
</p>
<p>d. For a dependent child who has coverage under either or both parents' plans and also has his or her
own coverage as a dependent under a spouse's plan, the rule in the section above for &ldquo;Longer or
Shorter Length of Coverage&rdquo; applies.
</p>
<p>In the event the dependent child's coverage under the spouse's plan began on the same date as the
dependent child's coverage under either or both parents' plans, the order of benefits will be determined by
applying the birthday rule to the dependent child's parent(s) and the dependent's spouse.
</p>
<p>Rules for Coordination of Benefits
</p>
<p>When a person is covered by two (2) or more plans, the rules for determining the order of benefit
payments are as follows:
</p>
<p>1. The primary plan must pay or provide its benefits as if the secondary plan or plans did not exist.
</p>
<p>2. If the primary plan is a Closed Panel Plan, and the secondary plan is not a Closed Panel Plan, the
secondary plan will pay or provide benefits as if it were the primary plan when a covered person uses
a non-panel provider, except for emergency services or authorized referrals that are paid or provided
by the primary provider.
</p>
<p>3. When multiple contracts providing coordinated coverage are treated as a single plan, this section only
applies to the plan as a whole, and coordination among the component contracts is governed by the
terms of the contracts.
</p>
<p>4. If a person is covered by more than one secondary plan, each secondary plan will take into
consideration the benefits of the primary plan, or plans, and the benefits of any other plan, which, has
its benefits determined before those of that secondary plan.
</p>
<p>5. Under the terms of a Closed Panel Plan, benefits are not payable if the covered person does not use
the services of a closed panel provider, with the exceptions of medical emergencies and if there are
allowable benefits available. In most instances, Coordination of Benefits does not occur if a covered
person is enrolled in two (2) or more Closed Panel Plans and obtains services from a provider in one
of the Closed Panel Plans because the other Closed Panel Plan (the one whose providers were not
used) has no liability. However, Coordination of Benefits may occur during the claim determination
period when the covered person receives emergency services that would have been covered by both
plans.
</p>
<p>6. When this plan is secondary, it may reduce its benefits so that the total benefits paid or provided by
all plans during a plan year are not more than the total allowable expenses. In determining the
amount to be paid for any claim, the secondary plan will calculate the benefits it would have paid in
the absence of any other health coverage and apply that calculated amount to any allowable expense
under its plan that is unpaid by the primary plan. The secondary plan may reduce its payment by the
amount so that, when combined with the amount paid by the primary plan, the total benefit paid or
provided by all plans for the claim does not exceed the total allowable expense for that claim. In
addition, the secondary plan shall credit to its plan Deductible any amounts it would have credited to
its Deductible in the absence of other health care coverage.
</p>
<p>Determining Primacy Between Medicare and Us
</p>
<p>We will be the primary payer for persons with Medicare age 65 and older if the policyholder is actively
working for an employer who is providing the policy holder&rsquo;s health insurance and the employer has 20 or
more employees. Medicare will be the primary payer for persons with Medicare age 65 and older if the
policyholder is not actively working and the Member is enrolled in Medicare. Medicare will be the primary
payer for persons with Medicare age 65 and older if the employer has less than 20 employees and the
Member is enrolled in Medicare.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>112
</p>
<p>We will be the primary payer for persons enrolled with Medicare under age 65 when Medicare coverage
is due to disability if the policyholder is actively working for an employer who is providing the
policyholder&rsquo;s health insurance and the employer has 100 or more employees. Medicare will be the
primary payer for persons enrolled in Medicare due to disability if the policyholder is not actively working
or the employer has less than 100 employees.
</p>
<p>We will be the primary payer for persons with Medicare under age 65 when Medicare coverage is due to
End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), for the first 30 months from the entitlement to or eligibility for
Medicare (whether or not Medicare is taken at that time). After 30 months, Medicare will become the
primary payer if Medicare is in effect (30-month coordination period).
</p>
<p>When a Member becomes eligible for Medicare due to a second entitlement, such as age, We remain
primary. But this will only apply if the group health coverage was primary at the point when the second
entitlement took effect, for the duration of 30 months after becoming Medicare entitled or eligible due to
ESRD. If Medicare was primary at the point of the second entitlement, then Medicare remains primary.
There will be no 30-month coordination period for ESRD.
</p>
<p>Members with Medicare and Two Group Insurance Policies
</p>
<p>Based on the primacy rules, if Medicare is secondary to a group coverage (see Medicare primacy rules),
the primary coverage covering the Member will pay first. Medicare will then pay second, and the
coverage covering the Member as a retiree or inactive employee or Dependent will pay third. The order
of primacy is not based on the policyholder of the group health insurance.
</p>
<p>If Medicare is the primary payer due to Medicare primacy rules, then the rules of primacy for employees
and their spouses will be used to determine the coverage that will pay second and third.
</p>
<p>Your Obligations
</p>
<p>You have an obligation to provide us with current and accurate information regarding the existence of
other coverage.
</p>
<p>Benefits payable under another coverage include benefits that would be paid by that coverage, whether
or not a claim is made. It also includes benefits that would have been paid but were refused. This is due
to the claim not being sent to the Provider of other coverage on a timely basis.
</p>
<p>Your benefits under this Booklet will be reduced by the amount that such benefits would duplicate
benefits payable under the primary coverage.
</p>
<p>Our Rights to Receive and Release Necessary Information
</p>
<p>We may release to, or obtain, from any insurance company or other organization or person any
information which we may need to carry out the terms of this Booklet. Members will furnish to us such
information as may be necessary to carry out the terms of this Booklet.
</p>
<p>Payment of Benefits to Others
</p>
<p>When payments that should have been made under this Booklet were made under any other coverage,
we will have the right to pay to the other coverage any amount we determine to be warranted to satisfy
the intent of this provision. Any amount so paid will be considered to be benefits paid under this Booklet,
and with that payment we will fully satisfy our liability under this provision.</p>
<p/>
</div>

<p/>
<p>113
</p>
<p>Duplicate Coverage and Coordination of Benefits Overpayment Recovery
</p>
<p>If we have overpaid for Covered Services under this section, we will have the right, by offset or otherwise,
to recover the excess amount from you or any person or entity to which, or in whose behalf, the payments
were made.
</p>
<p>Pediatric Dental Coordination of Benefits
</p>
<p>Pediatric Dental Coordination of Benefits (COB) provisions apply when you or members of your family
have other coverage through another plan that offers dental benefits. When you have other coverage,
both plans will work together to provide the maximum benefits for which you are entitled. Coordinated
benefits will never be less than those normally provided under this plan. These Pediatric Dental COB
provisions are applicable to only the pediatric dental benefits found in the &ldquo;Benefits/Coverage (What is
Covered)&rdquo; section in the part &ldquo;Dental Services for Members thorough Age 18&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>If you are eligible for benefits through two or more plans, one of the plans will be responsible for &ldquo;primary
coverage.&rdquo; This means dental benefits will be provided by the primary coverage before dental benefits of
the other plan will be provided. A plan determined to be secondary shall pay the lesser of either the
amount that it would have paid in the absence of any other dental benefit coverage, or the enrollee&rsquo;s total
out of pocket cost payable under the primary dental benefit plan for dental benefits covered under the
secondary plan.
</p>
<p>1. If You have Pediatric Dental Essential Health Benefits that are included as part of Your medical plan,
the medical plan will be the primary coverage and any standalone dental plan will be secondary
coverage.
</p>
<p>2. If the member has two medical plans, each offering Pediatric Dental Essential Health Benefit
coverage for spouse and family, the Order of Benefits Determination rules above apply.</p>

</p>
<p>Section 12. Termination/Nonrenewal/Continuation
</p>
<p>Termination
</p>
<p>Except as otherwise provided, your coverage may terminate in the following situations:
</p>
<p>&middot; When the Contract between the Group and us terminates. If your coverage is through an association,
your coverage will terminate when the Contract between the association and us terminates, or when
your Group leaves the association. It will be the Group's responsibility to notify you of the termination
of coverage.
</p>
<p>&middot; If you choose to terminate your coverage.
</p>
<p>&middot; If you or your Dependents cease to meet the eligibility requirements of the Plan, subject to any
applicable continuation requirements. If you cease to be eligible, the Group and/or you must notify us
immediately. The Group and/or you shall be responsible for payment for any services incurred by
you after you cease to meet eligibility requirements.
</p>
<p>&middot; If you elect coverage under another carrier&rsquo;s health benefit plan, which is offered by the Group as an
option instead of this Plan, subject to the consent of the Group. The Group agrees to immediately
notify us that you have elected coverage elsewhere.
</p>
<p>&middot; If you perform an act, practice, or omission that constitutes fraud or make an intentional
misrepresentation of material fact, as prohibited by the terms of your Plan, your coverage and the
coverage of your Dependents can be retroactively terminated or rescinded. A rescission of coverage
means that the coverage may be legally voided back to the start of your coverage under the Plan, just
as if you never had coverage under the Plan.  You will be provided with a 30 calendar day advance
notice with appeal rights before your coverage is retroactively terminated or rescinded. You are
responsible for paying us for the cost of previously received services based on the Maximum
Allowable Amount for such services, less any Copayments made or Premium paid for such services.
</p>
<p>&middot; If you fail to pay or fail to make satisfactory arrangements to pay your portion of the Premium, we may
terminate your coverage and may also terminate the coverage of your Dependents.
</p>
<p>&middot; If you permit the fraudulent use of your or any other Member&rsquo;s Plan Identification Card by any other
person; use another person&rsquo;s Identification Card; or use an invalid Identification Card to obtain
services, your coverage will terminate immediately upon our written notice to the Group. Anyone
involved in the misuse of a Plan Identification Card will be liable to and must reimburse us for the
Maximum Allowed Amount for services received through such misuse.
</p>
<p>&middot; If the Subscriber moves outside of the Service Area and the Subscriber&rsquo;s place of employment is not
located within the Service Area.
</p>
<p>&middot; If you are a partner to a civil union, recognized domestic partnership, or other relationship recognized
as a spousal relationship in the state where the subscriber resides, on the date such union or
relationship is revoked or terminated. Also, if there is coverage for designated beneficiaries, on the
date a Recorded Designated Beneficiary Agreement is revoked or terminated. Where permitted by
law, such a Dependent may be able to seek COBRA or state continuation coverage, subject to the
terms of this Booklet.
</p>
<p>You will be notified in writing of the date your coverage ends by either us or the Group.
</p>
<p>Removal of Members
</p>
<p>Upon written request through the Group, you may cancel your coverage and/or your Dependent&rsquo;s
coverage from the Plan. If this happens, no benefits will be provided for Covered Services after the</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>115
</p>
<p>termination date even if we have preauthorized the service, unless the Provider confirmed eligibility within
two business days before the service is received.
</p>
<p>Special Rules if Your Group Health Plan is Offered Through an
Exchange
</p>
<p>If your Plan is offered through an Exchange, either you or your Group may cancel your coverage and/or
your Dependent&rsquo;s coverage through the Exchange. Each Exchange will have rules on how to do this.
You may cancel coverage by sending a written notice to either the Exchange or us. The date that
coverage will end will be either:
</p>
<p>&middot; The date that you ask for coverage to end, if you provide written notice within 14 days of that date; or
</p>
<p>&middot; 14 days after you ask for coverage to end, if you ask for a termination date more than 14 days before
you gave written notice. We may agree in certain circumstances to allow an earlier termination date
that you request.
</p>
<p>Continuation of Coverage Under Federal Law (COBRA)
</p>
<p>The following applies if you are covered by a Group that is subject to the requirements of the
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) of 1985, as amended.
</p>
<p>COBRA continuation coverage can become available to you when you would otherwise lose coverage
under your Group's health Plan. It can also become available to other Members of your family, who are
covered under the Group's health Plan, when they would otherwise lose their health coverage. For
additional information about your rights and duties under federal law, you should contact the Group.
</p>
<p>Qualifying events for Continuation Coverage under Federal Law (COBRA)
</p>
<p>COBRA continuation coverage is available when your coverage would otherwise end because of certain
&ldquo;qualifying events.&rdquo; After a qualifying event, COBRA continuation coverage must be offered to each
person who is a &ldquo;qualified beneficiary.&rdquo; You, your spouse and your Dependent children could become
qualified beneficiaries if you were covered on the day before the qualifying event and your coverage
would be lost because of the qualifying event. Qualified beneficiaries who elect COBRA must pay for this
COBRA continuation coverage.
</p>
<p>This benefit entitles each Member of your family who is enrolled in the Plan to elect continuation
independently. Each qualified beneficiary has the right to make independent benefit elections at the time
of annual enrollment. Covered Subscribers may elect COBRA continuation coverage on behalf of their
spouses, and parents or legal guardians may elect COBRA continuation coverage on behalf of their
children. A child born to, or placed for adoption with, a covered Subscriber during the period of
continuation coverage is also eligible for election of continuation coverage.
</p>
<p>Qualifying Event Length of Availability of Coverage
</p>
<p>For Subscribers:
</p>
<p>Voluntary or Involuntary Termination (other than gross
misconduct) or Loss of Coverage Under an Employer&rsquo;s
Health Plan Due to Reduction In Hours Worked

</p>
<p>36 months
</p>
<p>For Dependent Children:
</p>
<p>Loss of Dependent Child Status 36 months
</p>
<p>COBRA coverage will end before the end of the maximum continuation period listed above if you become
entitled to Medicare benefits. In that case a qualified beneficiary &ndash; other than the Medicare beneficiary &ndash;
is entitled to continuation coverage for no more than a total of 36 months. (For example, if you become
entitled to Medicare prior to termination of employment or reduction in hours, COBRA continuation
coverage for your spouse and children can last up to 36 months after the date of Medicare entitlement.)
</p>
<p>If Your Group Offers Retirement Coverage
</p>
<p>If you are a retiree under this Plan, filing a proceeding in bankruptcy under Title 11 of the United States
Code may be a qualifying event. If a proceeding in bankruptcy is filed with respect to your Group, and
that bankruptcy results in the loss of coverage, you will become a qualified beneficiary with respect to the
bankruptcy. Your Dependents will also become qualified beneficiaries if bankruptcy results in the loss of
their coverage under this Plan. If COBRA coverage becomes available to a retiree and his or her covered
family members as a result of a bankruptcy filing, the retiree may continue coverage for life and his or her
Dependents may also continue coverage for a maximum of up to 36 months following the date of the
retiree&rsquo;s death.
</p>
<p>Second qualifying event
</p>
<p>If your family has another qualifying event (such as a legal separation, divorce, etc.) during the initial 18
months of COBRA continuation coverage, your Dependents can receive up to 18 additional months of
COBRA continuation coverage, for a maximum of 36 months from the original qualifying event. Such
additional coverage is only available if the second qualifying event would have caused your Dependents
to lose coverage under the Plan had the first qualifying event not occurred.
</p>
<p>Notification Requirements
</p>
<p>The Group will offer COBRA continuation coverage to qualified beneficiaries only after the Group has
been notified that a qualifying event has occurred. When the qualifying event is the end of employment or
reduction of hours of employment, death of the Subscriber, commencement of a proceeding in
bankruptcy with respect to the employer, or the Subscriber's becoming entitled to Medicare benefits
(under Part A, Part B, or both), the Group will notify the COBRA Administrator (e.g., Human Resources or
their external vendor) of the qualifying event.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>117
</p>
<p>You Must Give Notice of Some Qualifying Events
</p>
<p>For other qualifying events (e.g., divorce or legal separation of the Subscriber and spouse or a
Dependent child&rsquo;s losing eligibility for coverage as a Dependent child), you must notify the Group within
60 days after the qualifying event occurs.
</p>
<p>Electing COBRA Continuation Coverage
</p>
<p>To continue your coverage, you or an eligible family Member must make an election within 60 days of the
date your coverage would otherwise end, or the date the company&rsquo;s benefit Plan Administrator notifies
you or your family Member of this right, whichever is later. You must pay the total Premium appropriate
for the type of benefit coverage you choose to continue. If the Premium rate changes for active
associates, your monthly Premium will also change. The Premium you must pay cannot be more than
102% of the Premium charged for Employees with similar coverage, and it must be paid to the company&rsquo;s
benefit plan administrator within 30 days of the date due, except that the initial Premium payment must be
made before 45 days after the initial election for continuation coverage, or your continuation rights will be
forfeited.
</p>
<p>Disability extension of 18-month period of continuation coverage
</p>
<p>For Subscribers who are determined, at the time of the qualifying event, to be disabled under Title II
(OASDI) or Title XVI (SSI) of the Social Security Act, and Subscribers who become disabled during the
first 60 days of COBRA continuation coverage, coverage may continue from 18 to 29 months. These
Subscribers&rsquo; Dependents are also eligible for the 18- to 29-month disability extension. (This also applies
if any covered family Member is found to be disabled.) This would only apply if the qualified beneficiary
gives notice of disability status within 60 days of the disabling determination. In these cases, the
Employer can charge 150% of Premium for months 19 through 29. This would allow health coverage to
be provided in the period between the end of 18 months and the time that Medicare begins coverage for
the disabled at 29 months. (If a qualified beneficiary is determined by the Social Security Administration to
no longer be disabled, such qualified beneficiary must notify the Plan Administrator of that fact in writing
within 30 days after the Social Security Administration&rsquo;s determination.)
</p>
<p>Trade Adjustment Act Eligible Individual
</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t initially elect COBRA coverage and later become eligible for trade adjustment assistance
under the U.S. Trade Act of 1974 due to the same event which caused you to be eligible initially for
COBRA coverage under this Plan, you will be entitled to another 60-day period in which to elect COBRA
coverage. This second 60-day period will commence on the first day of the month on which you become
eligible for trade adjustment assistance. COBRA coverage elected during this second election period will
be effective on the first day of the election period.
</p>
<p>When COBRA Coverage Ends
</p>
<p>COBRA benefits are available without proof of insurability and coverage will end on the earliest of the
following:
</p>
<p>&middot; A covered individual reaches the end of the maximum coverage period;
&middot; A covered individual fails to pay a required Premium on time;
&middot; A covered individual becomes covered under any other group health plan after electing COBRA. If
</p>
<p>the other group health plan contains any exclusion or limitation on a pre-existing condition that
applies to you, you may continue COBRA coverage only until these limitations cease;
</p>
<p>&middot; A covered individual becomes entitled to Medicare after electing COBRA; or
&middot; The Group terminates all of its group welfare benefit plans.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>118
</p>
<p>Other Coverage Options Besides COBRA Continuation Coverage
</p>
<p>Instead of enrolling in COBRA continuation coverage, there may be other coverage options for you and
your family through the Health Insurance Marketplace, Medicaid, or other group health plan coverage
options (such as a spouse&rsquo;s plan) through what is called a &ldquo;special enrollment period.&rdquo; Some of these
options may cost less than COBRA continuation coverage. You can learn more about many of these
options at www.healthcare.gov.
</p>
<p>If You Have Questions
</p>
<p>Questions concerning your Group's health Plan and your COBRA continuation coverage rights should be
addressed to the Group. For more information about your rights under ERISA, including COBRA, the
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and other laws affecting group health plans,
contact the nearest Regional or District Office of the U.S. Department of Labor&rsquo;s Employee Benefits
Security Administration (EBSA) in your area or visit the EBSA website at www.dol.gov/ebsa. (Addresses
and phone numbers of Regional and District EBSA Offices are available through EBSA&rsquo;s website.)
</p>
<p>Continuation of Coverage Under State Law
</p>
<p>Groups with less than 20 employees who provide health care coverage for their employees are subject to
state law for continuation of coverage. The state continuation coverage period will not exceed 18 months
for you and/or any Dependents. State continuation coverage for you and your Dependents will start on
the date of the earliest of the following qualifying events:
</p>
<p>&middot; Your termination of employment. To qualify, you must have been covered by the Group health
coverage for at least (6) six straight months;
</p>
<p>&middot; Your reduction in working hours which results in loss of coverage. Reduction in working hours would
include circumstances resulting from economic conditions, injury, disability, or chronic health
conditions;
</p>
<p>&middot; Your death; or
</p>
<p>&middot; Divorce or legal separation of you and the spouse.
</p>
<p>State Continuation Coverage Notification
</p>
<p>Unless termination or reduction in working hours is the qualifying event, a Subscriber, spouse or
Dependent child must tell the Group of their choice to keep coverage within 30 days after being eligible.
The Group is responsible for telling the Subscriber, spouse and/or Dependent child of how to choose
state continuation. Once the Group has given notice to the Subscriber, spouse and/or Dependent child,
we must get timely notice from the Group that you want state continuation. We must also get timely
payment of Premiums from the Group when paid by the Subscriber.
</p>
<p>We should get the notice from the Group and your first no later than 30 days after the qualifying event. If
the group fails to give timely notice to you of your rights, this deadline may extend to 60 days after the
qualifying event. For more, contact your Group.
</p>
<p>When State Continuation Coverage Ends
</p>
<p>Your state continuation coverage ends upon the earlier of the following:
</p>
<p>&middot; A covered individual reaches the end of the maximum coverage period;
</p>
<p>&middot; The Group Master Contract between Us and your employer ends. If the employer gets other group
coverage, continuation coverage will continue under the new plan;</p>

<p/>

</p>
<p>&middot; A covered individual fails to pay Premium timely;
</p>
<p>&middot; You are eligible for another group health plan unless the other plan does not cover something that is
covered by the continuation coverage. In that case, the state continuation coverage lasts until the
continuation period ends or the other plan covers the excluded condition;
</p>
<p>&middot; If you are covered as a Designated Beneficiary, on the date the Recorded Designated Beneficiary
Agreement is revoked or terminated;

</p>
<p>Continuation of Coverage Due To Military Service
</p>
<p>Under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA), the
Subscriber or his / her Dependents may have a right to continue health care coverage under the Plan if
the Subscriber must take a leave of absence from work due to military leave.
</p>
<p>Employers must give a cumulative total of five years and in certain instances more than five years, of
military leave.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Military service&rdquo; means performance of duty on a voluntary or involuntary basis and includes active duty,
active duty for training, initial active duty for training, inactive duty training, and full-time National Guard
duty.
</p>
<p>During a military leave covered by USERRA, the law requires employers to continue to give coverage
under this Plan to its Members. The coverage provided must be identical to the coverage provided to
similarly situated, active employees and Dependents. This means that if the coverage for similarly
situated, active employees and Dependents is modified, coverage for you (the individual on military leave)
will be modified.
</p>
<p>You may elect to continue to cover yourself and your eligible Dependents by notifying your employer in
advance and submitting payment of any required contribution for health coverage. This may include the
amount the employer normally pays on your behalf. If your military service is for a period of time less
than 31 days, you may not be required to pay more than the active Member contribution, if any, for
continuation of health coverage. For military leaves of 31 days or more, you may be required to pay up to
102% of the full cost of coverage, i.e., the employee and employer share.
</p>
<p>The amount of time you continue coverage due to USERRA will reduce the amount of time you will be
eligible to continue coverage under COBRA.
</p>
<p>Maximum Period of Coverage During a Military Leave
</p>
<p>Continued coverage under USERRA will end on the earlier of the following events:
</p>
<p>1. The date you fail to return to work with the Group following completion of your military leave.
Subscribers must return to work within:
</p>
<p>a) The first full business day after completing military service, for leaves of 30 days or less. A
reasonable amount of travel time will be allowed for returning from such military service.
</p>
<p>b) 14 days after completing military service for leaves of 31 to 180 days,
</p>
<p>c) 90 days after completing military service for leaves of more than 180 days; or</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>120
</p>
<p>2. 24 months from the date your leave began.
</p>
<p>Reinstatement of Coverage Following a Military Leave
</p>
<p>Regardless of whether you continue coverage during your military leave, if you return to work your health
coverage and that of your eligible Dependents will be reinstated under this Plan if you return within:
</p>
<p>1. The first full business day of completing your military service, for leaves of 30 days or less. A
reasonable amount of travel time will be allowed for returning from such military service;
</p>
<p>2. 14 days of completing your military service for leaves of 31 to 180 days; or
</p>
<p>3. 90 days of completing your military service for leaves of more than 180 days.
</p>
<p>If, due to an illness or injury caused or aggravated by your military service, you cannot return to work
within the time frames stated above, you may take up to:
</p>
<p>1. Two years; or
</p>
<p>2. As soon as reasonably possible if, for reasons beyond your control you cannot return within two years
because you are recovering from such illness or injury.
</p>
<p>If your coverage under the Plan is reinstated, all terms and conditions of the Plan will apply to the extent
that they would have applied if you had not taken military leave and your coverage had been continuous.
Any waiting/probationary periods will apply only to the extent that they applied before.
</p>
<p>Please note that, regardless of the continuation and/or reinstatement provisions listed above, this Plan
will not cover services for any illness or injury caused or aggravated by your military service, as indicated
in the "Limitations/Exclusions (What is Not Covered)" section.
</p>
<p>Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993
</p>
<p>A Subscriber who takes a leave of absence under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (the Act) will
still be eligible for this Plan during their leave. We will not consider the Subscriber and his or her
Dependents ineligible because the Subscriber is not at work.
</p>
<p>If the Subscriber ends their coverage during the leave, the Subscriber and any Dependents who were
covered immediately before the leave may be added back to the Plan when the Subscriber returns to
work without medical underwriting. To be added back to the Plan, the Group may have to give us
evidence that the Family and Medical Leave Act applied to the Subscriber. We may require a copy of the
health care Provider statement allowed by the Act.
</p>
<p>Benefits After Termination Of Coverage
</p>
<p>Except as stated below, we will not pay for any services given to you after your coverage ends even if we
preauthorized the service, unless the Provider confirmed your eligibility within two business days before
each service received. Benefits cease on the date your coverage ends as described above. You may be
responsible for benefit payments made by us on your behalf for services provided after your coverage
has ended.
</p>
<p>When your coverage ends for any reason other than for nonpayment of Premium, fraud or abuse, We will
continue coverage if you are being treated at an inpatient facility, until you are discharged or transferred
to another level of care. This is subject to the terms of this Booklet. The discharge date is seen as the
first date on which you are discharged from the facility or transferred to another level of care. We will not
cover the services you get after your discharge date.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>121
</p>
<p>Unless a law requires, we do not cover services after your date of termination even if:
</p>
<p>&middot; We approved the services; or
</p>
<p>&middot; The services were made necessary by an accident, illness or other event that occurred while
coverage was in effect.
</p>
<p>Discontinuation of Coverage
</p>
<p>We can refuse to renew your contract if we decide to discontinue a health coverage product that we offer
in the small group market. If we discontinue a health coverage product, we will provide the policyholder
advance notice of the discontinuation as required by applicable law with at least 90 days notice of the
discontinuation and with at least 180 days&rsquo; notice if we are discontinuing all small group products in the
state. In addition, your employer will be given the option to purchase any health coverage plan that we
currently offer without regard to claims status or health history. Nonrenewal will not affect an existing
claim.</p>

<p>Section 13. Appeals and Complaints
We want your experience with us to be as positive as possible. There may be times, however, when you
have a complaint, problem, or question about your Plan or a service you have received. In those cases,
please contact Member Services by calling the number on the back of your ID card. We will try to resolve
your complaint informally by talking to your Provider or reviewing your claim. If you are not satisfied with
the resolution of your complaint, you have the right to file a Grievance / Appeal, which is defined as
follows:
</p>
<p>We may have turned down your claim for benefits, your continuity of care request, or your request to
cover a Drug as an exception to the Prescription Drug List. We may have also denied your request to
preauthorize or receive a service or a supply. If you disagree with Our decision you can:
</p>
<p>1. File a complaint
</p>
<p>2. File an appeal; or
</p>
<p>3. File a grievance.
</p>
<p>Complaints
</p>
<p>If you want to file a complaint about our customer service or how we processed your claim, please call
Member Services. A trained staff member will try to clear up any confusion about the matter. They will
also try to resolve your complaint. If you prefer, you can send a written complaint to this address:

<p>If your complaint isn&rsquo;t solved either by writing or calling, or if you don&rsquo;t want to file a complaint, you can file
an appeal. We&rsquo;ll tell you how to do that next, in the Appeals section below.
</p>
<p>Appeals
</p>
<p>If we have denied a claim that you feel should have been covered, or handled in a different way, denied a
request to cover a Drug as an exception to the Prescription Drug List, or cancelled your coverage
retroactively for a reason that is not because of your failure to pay premiums, you can file an appeal. You</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>123
</p>
<p>can appeal a denial that was made by us before the service is received. You can also appeal a denial on
a service after it is received. You may also appeal an eligibility determination made by us.
</p>
<p>If, after our denial, we consider, rely on or generate any new or additional evidence in connection with
your claim, we will provide you with that new or additional evidence, free of charge. We will not base our
appeal decision on a new or additional rationale without first providing you (free of charge) with, and a
reasonable opportunity to respond to, any such new or additional rationale. If we fail to follow the Appeal
procedures outlined under this section the Appeals process may be deemed exhausted. However, the
Appeals process will not be deemed exhausted due to minor violations that do not cause, and are not
likely to cause, prejudice or harm so long as the error was for good cause or due to matters beyond our
control.
</p>
<p>While we encourage you to file an appeal within 60 days of the unfavorable benefit determination, the
written or oral appeal must be received by us within 180 days of the unfavorable benefit determination.
We will assign an employee to help you in the appeal process. An appeal can be filed verbally by calling
Member Services.

</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to file a complaint before you file an appeal. In your appeal, please state as plainly as
possible why you think we shouldn&rsquo;t have denied your claim for benefits. Include any documents you
didn&rsquo;t submit with the original claim or service/supply request. Also send any other documents that
support your appeal. You don&rsquo;t have to file the appeal yourself. Someone else, like your Doctor or
another representative, can file an appeal for you. Just let us know in writing who will be filing the appeal
for you.
</p>
<p>The appeals process allows you to request an internal appeal, and in certain cases, an independent
external appeal.
</p>
<p>Internal Appeals
</p>
<p>We have an internal process that We follow when reviewing your appeal. Members of our staff, who were
not involved when your claim was first denied, will review the appeal. They may also talk with co-workers
to assist in the review.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>124
</p>
<p>If your first internal appeal is denied, you can ask for a second level appeal. But you don&rsquo;t have to file a
second level appeal with Us before requesting an independent external review appeal or pursuing legal
action.
</p>
<p>Expedited internal appeal &ndash; If you have an urgent case, you may request that your internal appeal be
reviewed in a shorter time period. This is called an expedited internal appeal. You or your representative
can ask for an expedited appeal if you had Emergency services but haven&rsquo;t been discharged from the
Facility. Also, you can ask for an expedited appeal if the regular appeal schedule would:
</p>
<p>&middot; Seriously jeopardize your life or health;
</p>
<p>&middot; Jeopardize your ability to regain maximum function;
</p>
<p>&middot; Create an immediate and substantial limitation on your ability to live independently, if you&rsquo;re disabled;
or
</p>
<p>&middot; In the opinion of a Doctor with knowledge of your condition, would subject you to severe pain that
can&rsquo;t be adequately managed without the service in question.
</p>
<p>Independent External Appeals
</p>
<p>For claims based on Utilization Review, or a rescission or retroactive cancellation of coverage for reasons
other than nonpayment of premium, or a denial of a request to cover a Drug as an exception to the
Prescription Drug List, you can request an independent external appeal. Utilization Review includes
claims we denied as Experimental or Investigational or not Medically Necessary. It also includes claims
where we reviewed your medical circumstances to decide if an exclusion applied. For these appeals, your
case is reviewed by an external review entity, selected by the Colorado Division of Insurance. There is no
minimum dollar amount for a claim to be eligible for an external review.
</p>
<p>Your request for independent external review must be made within 4 months of our appeal decision.
Generally, you have to have completed at least the first level internal appeal. But if we fail to handle the
appeal according to applicable Colorado insurance law and regulations, you will be eligible to request
independent external review.
</p>
<p>Expedited external appeal &ndash; You or your representative can request an expedited independent external
review, but only in certain cases:
</p>
<p>&middot; You had Emergency services but haven&rsquo;t been discharged from the Facility.
</p>
<p>&middot; A Doctor certifies to us that you have a medical condition where following the normal external review
appeal process would seriously jeopardize your life or health, would jeopardize your ability to regain
maximum function or, if you&rsquo;re disabled, would create an imminent and substantial limitation of your
ability to live independently; or
</p>
<p>&middot; We denied coverage for a requested medical service as being Experimental or Investigational, your
treating physician certifies in writing that the requested service would be significantly less effective if
not promptly initiated and certifies that either:
</p>
<p>- Standard health care services or treatments have not been effective in improving your condition
or are not medically appropriate for you; or
</p>
<p>- The Doctor is a licensed, board-certified or board-eligible physician qualified to practice in the
area of medicine appropriate to treat your condition, there is no available standard health care
service or treatment covered by this Booklet that is more beneficial than the requested service,
and scientifically valid studies using accepted protocols demonstrate that the requested service is
likely to be more beneficial to you than any available standard services.</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p/>
<p>125
</p>
<p>If it meets these conditions, your request for expedited external appeal can be filed at the same time as
your request for an expedited internal appeal. There is no minimum dollar amount for a claim to be
eligible for an external review.
</p>

<p>Section 14. Information on Policy and Rate Changes
</p>
<p>Insurance Premiums
</p>
<p>How Premiums are Established and Changed &ndash; Premiums are the monthly charges you and/or the
Group must pay us to get coverage. We figure out and set the required Premiums.
</p>
<p>The Group is responsible for paying the employee&rsquo;s Premium to us according to the terms of the Group
Contract. Groups may have you contribute to the Premium cost through payroll deduction. Some Groups
may choose to have your Premium determined by the age of the Subscriber, with Premium set by age
brackets. We may change membership Premiums on the annual date on which the Group renews its
coverage, which we may assess when a Subscriber changes to a new five-year increment age bracket,
e.g., age 25 through age 29. If the age of the Subscriber is misstated at enrollment, all amounts payable
for the correct age will be adjusted and billed to the Group.
</p>
<p>Grace Period - If a Group fails to submit Premium payments to us in a timely manner, the Group is
entitled to a grace period of 31 days for the payment of such Premium. During the grace period, our
contract with the Group shall continue in force unless the Group gives us written notice of termination of
the contract. If the Group has obtained replacement coverage during the grace period, the contract with
us will be terminated as of the last day for which we have received Premium, and any and all claims paid
during the grace period will be retroactively adjusted to deny. These claims that we retroactively
deny should be submitted to the replacement carrier. If the Group has not obtained replacement
coverage during the grace period, or fails to inform Us that the employer has not obtained replacement
coverage, we will process any and all claims with dates of service during the grace period in accordance
with the terms of this Booklet.</p>
